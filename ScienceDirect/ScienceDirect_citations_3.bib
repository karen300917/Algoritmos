However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches.}

Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies.}

This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed.}

El presente artículo presenta una propuesta de intervención para el desarrollo del pensamiento computacional en educación infantil, mediante un robot de suelo con mandos de direccionalidad programada.

La fiabilidad del sistema de observación se ha garantizado en forma de concordancia interobservadores, calculada a través del coeficiente Kappa de Cohen (1960). En el seno de la teoría de la generalizabilidad, el plan de medida [Categorías] [Steps]/ [Participantes] ha permitido constatar una elevada fiabilidad de precisión de generalización de los resultados. La operatividad del sistema de observación ha quedado reflejada en las estructuras regulares de conducta (T-patterns) detectadas -mediante el software THEME-, que han permitido caracterizar dificultades en la asimilación de un lenguaje computacional incipiente relacionadas con la capacidad de orientación espacial y la capacidad de secuenciación del niño -situaciones que implican giro y número de comandos empleados en la secuencia-.

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community.}

Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. The task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.}

Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.}

I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.}

Computational intelligence (CI) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. Thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt CI in e-commerce within the boundaries of IM. Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions. Further, CI uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units. This allows e-customers to compare the attributes of similar products.}

abstract = {In the context of digital transformation, educators are seeking ways to guide students to become innovative technology designers. However, students often lack innovative problem-solving skills when working with IT, and so new pedagogies are needed to improve IT-related curricula. Design thinking (DT), as a methodology, may offer the potential to meet this need. The present study developed a DT-based framework for the design of IT learning projects. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills. This study not only examines the impact of DT on IT education but also explores the mechanisms to explain the observed changes in learning performance. The findings can serve as a guide for educators and researchers to further optimize the teaching of IT courses and nurture innovative talents required in the new era.}

abstract = {In the present work, efforts have been made to create a configuration-based approach to knowledge extraction. The notion of granularity is developed, which allows fine-tuning the expressive possibilities of the semantic network. As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters.}

This study aims to examine the effect of using block-based coding environments on enhancing secondary school students’ abstraction skills. Referring to the programming knowledge, a rubric was created to analyze the data from screen recordings, observation and interviews were used together to reveal the students’ abstraction performances. The results suggested that students performed high in elimination, focusing and generalization; however, students’ performances were relatively low in customization. Students’ explanations were mostly related the nature of the problems, affordances of BBPE and the programming constructs used in coding. We hope the study will provide insights for the efforts on instructional designs for successful abstraction experiences for young students.}

We conducted this scoping review to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children's concepts regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking.

There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS.}

We discuss the topical structures of ICCS, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development.}

These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior.}

Since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. Therefore, it is necessary to study the following AI education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. Experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students’ responses were better in the AI-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes.}

Such development emerges as the result of a series of research works in the Autonomous University of Queretaro with the main purpose of improving the way in which the design of reinforced concrete structures is taught in high education institutions. CALRECOD uses optimization methods and algorithms to aid students in their design interaction learning so that they are able to compare their own designs and what commercial software delivers with optimal ones given certain load conditions on the elements or structures. The software consists almost entirely of MatLab functions (.m files) and the ACI 318-19 code is taken as their main design reference to make it internationally useful, although in some cases the Mexican code NTC-17 specifications are used. Besides MatLab functions, the software consists as well of ANSYS SpaceClaim script functions (.scscript files) as an additional tool for the aid in the visualization of design results in a 3D space in the software ANSYS SpaceClaim. CALRECOD has proven to be versatile, flexible and of easy use with a huge potential to increase learning outcomes for students in high education programs related with the design of reinforced concrete structures as well as to enhance the creation of efficient interactive environments for researchers and academics focused on the development of new design and analysis methods for such structures. With their optimization design functions, a solid comparison platform of designs’ performance could be laid out, and with its extended function design packages for structural systems, reinforced concrete design courses could be enhanced in a great deal regarding their program content’s scope.

In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.}

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach.

In this context, this paper proposes a fuzzy knowledge-based solution to build practical pupils, educators, and decision-makers recommender system to support the development of SR competencies in a data driver manner. Our system consists of:(1) inferring and computational module that calculates in a fuzzy manner the global appreciation to each SR-competencies. (2) recommendation module that aims to help learners, educators and decision makers to assess the degree of development of SR competencies and to get alternative suggestion of remediation. The proposed solution has been tested on the last two levels of science education in four Tunisian elementary schools in different regions. A preliminary analysis showed that the learning process should be more focused on Tunisian pupil's profile, and that investigation and collaborative based learning should be applied further in Tunisian classroom.}

The model, entitled DORIT (“Do your Own Research In Technology”), contributes to Child–Computer Interaction research by providing scaffolding for teachers to create teaching activities emphasising a critical inquiry approach to computational empowerment. We present the DORIT model, its research base and report from a study where 18 in-service teachers took part in codesigning and testing lesson plans based on the model for grades 1, 6, 7 and 9. The lesson plans serve as proof-of-concept demonstrations of how the DORIT model can scaffold teaching activities. We further analyse how the teachers used the model in practice, and report from post-interviews with the teachers regarding their experiences with the model. We conclude the paper by discussing the potentials and challenges of the DORIT model to support computational empowerment in future CCI research.}

abstract = {Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.}

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.}

In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.}

This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion.}

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum.}

Consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with CT and programming. This paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. It is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the student’s progress and customize in-game tasks. Four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used. Based on the results of these experiences, the key contribution of this paper is a set of fourteen findings and recommendations to the creation and use of a game-based approach to support introductory computer programming learning for novices.}

Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.}

After decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce CS into the 11-16 age school curriculums. Immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no CS background and an estimated need for 20,000 new CS teachers - existing UK IT teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. The Computing at School (CAS) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an IT to Computing syllabus, as have the British Computer Society (BCS), leading UK universities and a number of major international technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, British Telecom and Facebook.This paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. It describes, in particular, the work of the BCS-funded Glyndwr University ‘Turing Project’ in introducing Welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and ‘computational thinking’. The Turing Project uses an innovative combination of Lego NXT Mindstorm robots, Raspberry Pi computers and PicoBoard hardware together with the Robot C and Scratch programming platforms. The paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme.

In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design. Following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in STEAM education, and inspired in the 4E cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic STEAM learning systems and settings. The framework is aimed at STEAM educational psychologists, educational technologists, learning designers and educational practitioners who wish to address the global challenges of 21st century education by means of creative, innovative and inclusive education design.}

The book is commendable for its tight integration of technical and socio-critical aspects of computing, approachable conversational style, and collection of flexible and practical resources for teachers.

It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.}

abstract = {Block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”.}

Among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.}

The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.}

In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.}

Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.}

Yet modern programming and scripting languages and rich computational environments such as R and MATLAB present significant barriers to those with limited exposure to computer science, and may require substantial tutorial assistance over an extended period if progress is to be made. In this paper we report our experience of undergraduate bioinformatics education using the familiar, ubiquitous spreadsheet environment of Microsoft Excel.

Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured.}

Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents. The evidence shows emerging ways children relate to these. The potential of including children's actions and voices in the ongoing societal and educational debates on AI is discussed.}

First, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three ePCR-related knowledge: ePCR functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students ePCR technology in middle-grade math lessons. Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects. Implications for educators and researchers were discussed at the end of the article.}

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared.}

Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings.}

We measured and compared cytokine milieu in samples collected via Softcup® menstrual cup versus vulvovaginal swabs. One hundred and eighty vulvovaginal swabs from CAPRISA 088 and 42 Softcup supernatants from CAPRISA 016 cohorts of pregnant women were used to measure the concentrations of 28 cytokines through multiplexing. Cytokines measured in this study were detectable in each of the methods however, SoftCup supernatants showed consistently, higher detectability, expression ratios, and mean concentration of cytokines than vulvovaginal swabs. While mean concentrations differed, the majority of cytokines correlated between SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swabs. Additionally, there were no significant differences in a number of participants between the two sampling methods for the classification of genital inflammation. Our findings suggest that SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swab samples are suitable for the collection of genital specimens to study biological markers of genital inflammatory response. However, the Softcup menstrual cup performs better for the detection and quantification of soluble biomarkers that are found in low concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid.}

Computational thinking, effective communication, and digital literacy scales were used and a significant correlation was found between all the 21st century skills. A series of structural equation models were tested. The final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. However, somewhat different from predictions is the finding that communication skills directly predict problem solving without further mediation. Thus, overall, the findings indicate that critical thinking has a crucial mediating role between other 21st century skills and problem solving.}

abstract = {3D game development can be an enticing way to attract K-12 students to computer science, but designing and programming 3D games is far from trivial. Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. Our formal user study shows that with Incremental 3D, the gradual approach to transition from 2D to 3D authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3D games including 3D models, animations, and programming.}

Interest in robotics usage to develop such competencies in educational settings arises but there hasn't been so far mapping of the research conducted in this field. Thus, we present a scoping review of 59 articles published from 2012 to 2023 in 4 Databases and 2 Registers examining kindergarteners' skills through Educational Robotics. Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized. Our findings depict that several skills are evaluated using different terms. Critical thinking is examined most frequently, creativity the least, and communication is integrated into collaboration and the opposite. Most of the researchers used the mixed method focusing on qualitative tools, examining quite a small sample size, and conducting the intervention for a short time. Also: BeeBot, Lego robotics kits (WeDo, Mindstorms), and social, humanoid robots are often used. Additionally, the evaluation tools used in the reviewed papers are presented and categorized into groups. This scoping demonstrates that robotics might affect positively the children's cognitive skills and creativity but may not facilitate their interactions so much regarding emotional expressions. Moreover, a gap in quantitative research on kindergarteners' skills development via Educational Robotics is spotted. Finally, this scoping review suggests: creating clear terms for skills, developing robotics tailored to kindergarten age, forming full robotics activities, and designing modular evaluation tools for young learners' capacities.}

Referencing Dweck and Leggett’s (1988) framework for implicit beliefs of intelligence, we examined how (1) students’ implicit beliefs changed over the course of a semester, (2) these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profile, and (3) implicit beliefs predicted student learning based on standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test. For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses. Theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for STEM educators are discussed.}

abstract = {Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems.}

One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.}

This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching. Although students demonstrate a strong interest in learning, their foundation is weak, resulting in poor learning outcomes. Consequently, the author provides specific recommendations regarding programming education's working mechanism, curriculum standard system, teacher training, and educational resources sharing to better develop programming education in primary and secondary schools.}

We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.}

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.}

To accomplish this objective, a review study with 181 publications was conducted, with a particular focus on 41 publications explicitly addressing the integration of drones in secondary STEM education. Employing a systematic approach, this review identifies, analyzes, and synthesizes pertinent literature, ensuring a thorough comprehension of the current state of the field. The key findings of this review can be summarized as follows: 1) Among the diverse array of subjects incorporating drones, STEM disciplines emerge as the most prominently featured. 2) Experiential and project-based learning stand out as the most commonly adopted pedagogical methods in drone-integrated STEM education. The incorporation of teamwork and hands-on activities is frequently cited as instructional strategies aimed at enhancing drone-integrated STEM learning experiences. 3) Beyond the acquisition of drone-related technical skills, the reported learning outcomes encompass a spectrum of aspects, including heightened STEM career awareness, increased engagement and learning interest, and collaborative problem-solving abilities. The findings underscore the potential of drones to ignite passion for STEM subjects among secondary students, achieved through interdisciplinary, hands-on applications that foster problem-solving and design competencies.}

Specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) Combinatorics is accessible, 2) Combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) Combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) Combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) Combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity.

Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.}

abstract = {This paper investigates how children who are engaged in a creative project with tangible technology kits make sense of the system feedback the technology provides. A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits.}

Here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of Embodied Cognition. Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors.}

The research was carrying out during 2016–2018 school years. The study sample consists of 265 primary and secondary students from Lodz Voivodeship (province) in central Poland. The results were obtained from anonymous questionnaires completed by 221 course participants and their parents. The answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. Moreover, quantitative analysis of student’s finals projects also has been performed. In the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking. Moreover, children are supported by their parents, who notice how important these competences are and how great opportunities they will present for children in future. Authors continue to grow Scratch programming course to democratize access to new technologies and education, preparing future generation for a world in which computational and algorithmic thinking is a central part of problem-solving. Perhaps some of the course participants will continue their study of programming and make it a career for their life.}

abstract = {Along with the process of building China's modern vocational education system, China's higher vocational education has made great progress. With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability.}

The subject consists of learning objectives related to computing, design, and societal reflection and was first introduced as an elective course in 13 schools to investigate how it could be integrated into the Danish education system. We present four key findings based on school visits, interviews, an electronical survey, two questionnaires, and workshops including theme discussions: (1) teachers did not perceive Technology Comprehension as a distinct subject, but rather as a set of skills that can be integrated into other subjects; (2) teachers pointed out that Technology Comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but they need more scaffolding and support; (3) Technology Comprehension challenges teachers’ existing competencies and there is a need for a framework that takes into account computing, design, and societal reflection as a whole; (4) Technology Comprehension appealed to various kind of students, not only those who are enthusiastic about technical matters. This study contributes to the previous research on making and digital fabrication by addressing how these endeavours are implemented on a national level through engaging with local teachers. We call for more research on scaffolding and supporting teachers to orchestrate meaningful learning activities to successfully integrate Technology Comprehension into the Danish national education.}

This paper traces the historical roots of these concepts from the Pythagoreans and Aristotle to modern cognitive science and explores their relevance to contemporary technological applications. We examine how the Pythagoreans' view of mathematics as fundamental to understanding the universe and Aristotle's contributions to logic and categorization have shaped our current understanding of mathematical cognition and metacognition. The paper investigates the role of Boolean logic in computational processes and its relationship to human logical reasoning, as well as the significance of Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic in modelling uncertainty in human cognition and decision-making. We also explore the emerging field of Chemical Artificial Intelligence and its potential applications. We argue for unifying mathematical metacognition with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, while identifying the multifaceted benefits and challenges of such unification. The present paper examines essential research directions for integrating cognitive sciences and advanced technologies, discussing applications in education, healthcare, and business management. We provide suggestions for developing cognitive robots using specific cognitive tasks and explore the ethical implications of these advancements. Our analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to realize the full potential of this integration while mitigating potential risks.}

While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work.}

Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems.}

Yet, that development and its societal effects have been given minor attention in computing education in schools, which mainly focuses on rule-based programming. This article presents a pedagogical framework for supporting middle schoolers to become co-designers and makers of their own machine learning applications. It presents a case study conducted in the 6th grade of a Finnish elementary school and analyzes students’ (N=34) evolving ML ideas and explanations. Data consists of a children’s artwork, students’ design ideas and co-designed applications, and structured group interviews organized at the end of the ML project. The qualitative content analysis revealed how hands-on exploration with ML-based technologies supported students in developing various kinds of design ideas that harnessed face recognition, gestures, or voice recognition for solving real-life problems. The results of the study further indicated that co-designing ML applications provided a promising entry point for students to develop their conceptual understanding of ML principles, its workflows, and its role in their everyday practices. The article concludes with a discussion on how to support students to become innovators and software designers in the age of machine learning.}
