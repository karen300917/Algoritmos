abstract = {This study investigates the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational practices, specifically focusing on the design of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) lesson plans. Based on a particular IBL framework that synthesizes the core attributes of IBL by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators' potential utilization of GenAI tools across the framework's phases. Among other capabilities, GenAI tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. This examination informed the classification of GenAI tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. These groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the IBL framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. Several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. The systematic classification of GenAI tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of GenAI in education. Additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver IBL lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts.}

abstract = {Purpose
In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia.
Findings
From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter – tweeting and retweeting – imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL.
Research limitations/implications
Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens’ learning.
Originality/value
It is the first study in Spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring Twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools.}

Numerous studies have shown that AI robots may provide new opportunities for learning designs in school settings or professional training. However, there is no review examining the role and research foci of AI-Robots in Education (AIRE) research. This study therefore explored the research trends of AIRE by conducting a systematic review of SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journal articles published in the Web of Science (WoS). The study analyzed the participants, duration of the studies, learning environments, application domains, data analysis, evaluations of learners' performance, learning strategies, roles of AI-robots, and research issues. The research findings are concluded as follows: (1) The countries of Canada, Chile, and South Korea invested in AIRE research early, and focused on students' learning performance and learning behavior. (2) Most AIRE research focuses on research targets under the age of 13 and completed experiments within 4 weeks in a physical environment. Most AIRE research has been applied in the disciplines of Language and Science, and problem-solving related strategies and mixed strategies are the most commonly used strategies. (3) AI-robots are often applied and regarded as tutees or tutors. Regardless of what the AI-robot's role is, learning performance is the most widely focused variable in AIRE research. Furthermore, attitudes, opinions of learners or learning perceptions and learning behavior are other frequently discussed themes. To sum up, this study makes several recommendations for AIRE research for educators, researchers, and policy makers in higher education settings as a reference based on the results.}

Data collection was performed within an ethnographic approach with participant observation, questionnaires and social network interaction, and analysis was based on the constructs of Activity Theory. Four groups of students were identified with similar needs and motivations, each engaged at different levels according to the nature of the tasks, interaction with peers and educators, and personal expectations. Results reveal that, even in a supposedly fun and innovative context, the relationship between the object of the activity and the students' needs is crucial to promote engagement and learning. Identifying and taking into account students' needs and expectations is reinforced as an indispensable step in educational interventions.}

Due to the opaqueness of these assistants, however, children in particular might be unaware of potential negative consequences (e.g., with regard to privacy). To gain a deeper understanding of children’s knowledge about VAs, of how to facilitate knowledge regarding VA technology (focusing here on parental interventions), and of how children’s knowledge and understanding affects their communicative behavior towards VAs (focusing here on telling a secret to the VA), we conducted a longitudinal field study with 16 families (N=20 children). The emphasis was on differentiating between how VAs store and process data, as both aspects are important for a sophisticated usage but vary in how they are experienced or understood. The qualitative data demonstrated that children draw observable inferences from VAs’ behavior, which explains why children know more about how data is processed than about how it is stored or accessed. Our results indicate that parental interventions positively affect children’s understanding of data processing, but that this cannot be transferred to data storage, indicating the need for self-explaining systems. Lastly, knowledge about how data is stored negatively predicts the willingness to entrust a secret to the system, which underlines the importance of a basic understanding of how technologies work, also for younger users.}

One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend — such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at: https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021.}

The concept of digital divide, used to define individuals who do not have equal access to digital technologies, has started to be seen as a determining factor for digital competencies with its expanding scope. The current study aims to take a perspective to investigate the effect of socio-demographic variables, which may cause digital divide, on students' ICT literacy. With this study, it is sought to explain the effect of current inequalities regarding digital access on students' ICT skills. To this end, the socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the sample of Korea and Chile from the participating countries of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) were examined in the context of ICT literacy. The characteristics of the models created were compared for both countries. While parents’ level of education variable stands out for the Chilean model, the internet connection variable is remarkable for the Korean model. It is anticipated that the findings of the research will contribute to understanding the dynamics of the digital divide and its possible consequences, and can be a source for preventive policy steps to be developed.}

Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world.
Originality/value
While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems.}

This study explores the impact of providing players with the autonomy over the use of learning mechanic. Students interacted with two versions of a computer programming game prototype differing in the level of player agency in terms of freedom to employ the learning mechanics during gameplay. We employed quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate if player agency affected students’ learning outcomes, game enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation to learn. The results have implications for design of educational games, suggesting that incorporating player agency, particularly in the context of choosing learning mechanics, can enhance enjoyment and intrinsic motivation without compromising the educational effectiveness of the game.}

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12.
Aims
This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment.
Sample
One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72).
Methods
Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance.
Results
The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety.
Conclusions
The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education.}

To understand how such agent-based complex systems function and respond to change and disturbances, agent-based modeling (ABM) is increasingly recognized as the main way forward. Many motivating examples of agent-based models exist that are realistic enough to successfully support the management of complex systems, but these solutions are case-specific and contribute few general insights into the functioning of systems. General theory, though, is highly needed because we cannot model each system and question. Still, across disciplines, a critical mass of expertise has accumulated that could transform ABM into a more coherent and efficient approach to discover the functioning of complex social-economic-ecological systems. To this end, we need a cross-disciplinary discussion among researchers and a goal-oriented synthesis to identify the general principles and theories essential to improve our understanding and management of complex systems.}

Thus, nine original research studies (641 participants), published between 2010 and 2023, met the inclusion criteria defined in this systematic literature review. The main contributions of the application of AI in the assessment of students at these lower educational levels focus on predicting their performance, automating and making evaluations more objective by means of neural networks or natural language processing, the use of educational robots to analyse their learning process, and the detection of specific factors that make classes more attractive. This review shows the possibilities and already existing uses that AI can bring to education, specifically in the evaluation of student performance at the primary and secondary levels.

Dentro de este contexto, esta revisión pretende sintetizar las investigaciones existentes centradas en proporcionar mejoras en la evaluación del alumnado de primaria/secundaria utilizando alguna herramienta de IA. Así, nueve estudios de investigación originales (641 participantes), publicados entre 2010 y 2023, cumplen los criterios de inclusión definidos en esta revisión bibliográfica sistemática. Las principales aportaciones de la aplicación de la IA en la evaluación del alumnado de estos niveles educativos inferiores se centran en la predicción de su rendimiento, evaluaciones más objetivas y automatizadas mediante redes neuronales o procesamiento del lenguaje natural, el uso de robots educativos para analizar su proceso de aprendizaje y la detección de factores específicos que hacen más atractivas las clases. Esta revisión muestra las posibilidades y los usos ya existentes que la IA puede aportar a la educación, concretamente en la evaluación del rendimiento del alumnado de primaria y secundaria.}

Making focuses on the process that occurs in digital and/or physical spaces that is not always learning oriented, but enables qualities such as problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, and innovation, to name a few. Contemporary technical and infrastructural developments, such as Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, TechShops, and FabLabs, and the appearance of tools such as wearable computing, robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages, posit making as a very promising research area to support learning processes, especially towards the acquisition of 21st-century learning competences. Collecting learning evidence via rigorous multidimensional and multidisciplinary case studies will allow us to better understand and improve the value of making and the role of the various digital and physical spaces. Drawing from our experience with a recent workshop that used making as a pathway to foster joyful engagement and creativity in learning (Make2Learn), we present the developments, as well as the four selected contributions of this special issue. The paper further draws attention to the great potential and need for research in the area of making to enable entertaining, and engaging, and learning.}

abstract = {Background
In the etiology of functional chest pain (FCP), parental personality traits are worth considering in the context of the biopsychosocial model. The αlpha factor sub-dimension of the five-factor personality model (5FPM) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. There is increasing evidence that this dimension may be related to psychosomatic diseases. It was aimed to investigate how maternal personality traits affect adolescents with FCP. The hypothesis was determined that adolescents diagnosed with FCP can have lower quality of life and be more depressive/anxious and their mothers can have factor-α personality traits and be more depressive/anxious.
Methods
The sample of this single-center, cross-sectional, case-control study consisted of 25 adolescents with FCP and their parents. The control group consisted of 35 age and sex matched healthy adolescents and their parents. Psychopathology was screened using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and KINDL forms were completed by the adolescents. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Five-Factor Personality Inventory short form (FFPI) were completed by the parents.
Results
Mothers of adolescents with FCP scored significantly higher compared with mothers of healthy controls in agreeableness and conscientiousness and scored significantly lower in neuroticism. Higher levels of mothers’ neuroticism scores were associated with higher CDI and STAI-1 scores in FCP group. Agreeableness (Exp (B) = 10.097; p = .004; confidence interval [CI] = 2.049-49.745) and conscientiousness (Exp (B) = 16.414; p = .011; CI = 1.902-141.682) were statiscally significant in regression model.
Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that mother's alpha factor personality traits may be one of the factors that contribute to the presence of FCP.}

Following a review of the literature on epistemic practices including examples of argumentation, modeling and explanations, we focus on teachers' learning of argumentation. An important element of teachers' understanding of argumentation in science as an epistemic practice involves how they might potentially distinguish it from argumentation in other subject domains. In other words, given a broad set of subjects can be considered from an argumentation perspective (e.g., religious education, history, English), what differentiates argumentation as an epistemic practice of science? We will address this question by contrasting how argumentation is framed broadly in epistemic practices of two contrasting school subjects: science and religious education. Following this theoretical account, we will then draw on some empirical data from the Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science project based in England to illustrate how in-service science teachers view argumentation and engage in its teaching. Implications for curriculum reform as well as teacher education are discussed.}

This study aims to determine the mediator effect of ethics between the relationship of Mathematics Teacher Cooperation and Readiness in Facing the Era of Industrial Revolution. The study involved a total of 231 mathematics teachers in Indonesia and a total of 384 mathematics teachers in Malaysia using simple random sampling. A survey was conducted to determine the readiness of mathematics teachers in facing the industrial revolution. This study used SEM analysis (using AMOS software) to determine the model of teacher readiness facing the era of industrial revolution such as the direct effect of mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution, the essence of ethics as mediators of the relationship between mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution. The study findings showed collaboration has significant effect on IR4.0 readiness and the direct effect of collaboration on ethics was also significant. Indirectly, ethics has a significant mediating effect in the contribution between collaboration on the readiness of IR4.0 among mathematics teachers in Indonesia and Malaysia. A partial mediator occurred in the results of this study. In conclusion, the study's implications and recommendations emphasize the importance of collaborative practices, ethics, and cross-cultural considerations in preparing mathematics teachers for the Industrial Revolution era in Indonesia and Malaysia. These recommendations highlight the significance of policy support, professional development, ethical guidelines, and research-informed practices to enhance readiness for the challenges brought about by technological advancements.}

The pandemic has had serious ramifications for K-3 education, and the impact of distance learning on 21st century skill attainment are important issues to explore. Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.}

At the same time, augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. These results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments.}

Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant. Our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. We expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience.}

abstract = {Background
Critical thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training.
Methods
Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment.
Results
Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries.
Conclusion
Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a student's CT profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering CT skills. Future directions and limitations were discussed.}

However, further research is needed to understand how AWE is perceived by middle school students in the United States, as they have received less attention in this field. This study investigated U.S. middle school students’ perceptions of the MI Write AWE system. Students reported their perceptions of MI Write's usefulness using Likert-scale items and an open-ended survey question. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics in students’ comments, followed by qualitative analysis to interpret the themes related to those topics. We then examined whether these themes differed among students who agreed or disagreed that MI Write was a useful learning tool. The LDA analysis revealed four latent topics: (1) students desire more in-depth feedback, (2) students desire an enhanced user experience, (3) students value MI Write as a learning tool but desire greater personalization, and (4) students desire increased fairness in automated scoring. The distribution of these topics varied based on students’ ratings of MI Write's usefulness, with Topic 1 more prevalent among students who generally did not find MI Write useful and Topic 3 more prominent among those who found MI Write useful. Our findings contribute to the enhancement and implementation of AWE systems, guide future AWE technology development, and highlight the efficacy of LDA in uncovering latent topics and patterns within textual data to explore students’ perspectives of AWE.}

This study explores how lesson study (LS) can promote elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers’ professional development (TPD) in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes and beliefs in the maker education (ME) context.
Design/methodology/approach
This is a case study of a LS conducted in China involving four primary school teachers, 20 grade-4 students, and one researcher who also acted as a facilitator. This study adopted an integrated model that combined the unique characteristics of Chinese LS (CLS) with the Dutch LS (LSNL) model.
Findings
This study revealed that LS participation facilitates teachers’ integration of new ME pedagogical practices in their classrooms, while their attitudes and beliefs regarding teaching and learning are increasingly aligned with ME principles. However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of research skills, and insufficient learning resources have also been identified.
Research limitations/implications
This was a small-scale study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
This study expands the use of LS in the ME context by highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing teachers’ PD in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes, and beliefs. It also recommends incorporating diverse international LS models to address the limitations associated with localized models of TPD.
Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in its adoption of an integrated LS model to enhance STEM teachers’ PD in an ME context. The findings of this study further strengthen evidence supporting the positive impact of LS on teachers’ PD.}

abstract = {This paper describes a four-year observation using a model designed and tested in a middle school maker space, called problem-based science (PbS). PbS was used as the primary model for a middle school science curriculum adapted by the tools and mindsets of the maker movement. PbS is learning through inventing and problem solving — while using the latest in fabrication technology, like 3D printers and laser cutters, as well as more traditional making skills, like electronics, robotics, sewing and carpentry. PbS is based on Seymour Papert’s constructionism, set to a science curriculum taught full time in a makerspace or fablab. Bridging ideas in design thinking, maker education, and applied math and science, the term problem-based science was used to describe how learning would look, sound, and feel different in a makerspace, when a focus was on learner-centered curriculum. The design and testing of this curriculum took place as part of the 5th and 6th grade science courses offered at a private (non-public) school in California (USA) the fall of 2012, through the spring of 2016. Through daily formative assessment, as well as exit surveys, the patterns and benefits of learning in a self-directed learning space, designed for constructionism, were observed. This paper shares the highlights of those years. Video taped exit surveys conducted by the author, show that self-direction is both challenging and rewarding, students often felt trusted and respected, even if they did not always feel supported in a manner common in a more teacher directed classroom setting. Daily informal classroom observations revealed that using student driven, open-ended problem solving, rather than a 100% teacher led, step by step lab, lends to a more diverse pool of leadership practice in students and higher engagement in hard problems. Students typically seen as struggling in traditional classrooms, identified as experts and successful learners in this setting. Lastly, using PbS as a model for science literacy allows the youngest of learners to practice mindsets and habits typical of real scientists and inventors, fostering early identify formation in STEM fields.}

The advance is in establishing the mechanism for driving the dynamics of the sets and individuals. As a consequence, the behavior of the variables in query logical expression becomes predictable suppressing the possible semantic instability.}

Additionally, the trend toward precision medicine, in order to tailor decisions and therapies to the individual patient, generates enormous amounts of *omics data. Modern medicine is turning into a data science. The problem is that most of these data are in arbitrarily high dimensions, making manual analysis difficult, yet impossible for humans. This requires automated methods of data science, which is what machine learning provides. Automatic machine learning methods show impressive results in dealing with big data, because such algorithms can learn from training samples to gain knowledge from experience, thus helping to make decisions and predictions. The more data, the better these algorithms perform. Unfortunately, in medicine, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, “little data,” rare events, and complex data, where automatic approaches suffer from insufficient training sets. This calls for interactive machine learning with a doctor in the loop, who can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of data samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a medical professional involved in the machine learning pipeline.}

Firstly, an empirical study was designed with the aim of investigating the beliefs that High School Computing (HSC) teachers hold about: (a) their motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and self-expectations as Computing teachers, (b) the nature of HSC and its curricula, (c) how their students could be better learners in Computing, and the expectations they have of their students, and (d) their own teaching approaches and the alternatives they propose for best teaching of HSC. Secondly, an empirical study was realized to investigate the same HSC teachers' classroom practices. Thirdly, possible associations between the teachers' beliefs and their teaching practices were investigated. 25 HSC teachers participated, their beliefs being elicited through structured interviews, while their practices were investigated through non-participant observation, using structured observation sheets. The analysis of the data revealed that HSC teachers as a group held various beliefs about the aforementioned issues: some of these beliefs can ‘empower’ teachers to realize constructivist approaches while others can ‘constrain’ them to the well-known traditional behaviorist practices. The majority of HSC teachers expressed mixed beliefs (‘empowering’ and ‘constraining’) and reported feeling overwhelmed, with little control over their teaching, due to contextual barriers, the rapid evolution of Computing and, subsequently, their lack of knowledge about current trends and didactics in this discipline, as well as the perceived students' culture about Computing as playing games and surfing the Internet. Data analysis also shows that there are synergies between HSC teachers' beliefs and practices. In the case of mixed beliefs, at least one ‘constraining’ belief is reflected in teachers' real practices. However, the descriptions of practices given by most of those teachers during the interviews are not fully reflected in their practices.}

The main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure. The mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular Education, Learning, Teaching, Training, and Performing (Research, Development, Production, and Service) endeavors. In this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students' portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. It is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperative/collaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development.}

abstract = {For decades, computing speeds seemingly doubled every 24 months by increasing the processor clock speed, thus giving software a “free ride” to better performance. This free ride, however, effectively ended by the mid-2000s. With clock speeds having plateaued and computational horsepower instead increasing due to increasing the number of cores per processor, the vision for parallel computing, which started more than 40 years ago, is a revolution that has now (ubiquitously) arrived. In addition to traditional supercomputing clusters, parallel computing with multiple cores can be found in desktops, laptops, and even mobile smartphones. This ubiquitous parallelism in hardware presents a major challenge: the difficulty in easily extracting parallel performance via current software abstractions. Consequently, this paper presents an approach that reduces the learning curve to parallel programming by introducing such concepts into a visual (but currently sequential) programming language called Snap!, which was inspired by MIT’s Scratch project. Furthermore, our proposed visual abstractions can automatically generate parallel code for the end user to run in parallel on a variety of platforms from personal computing devices to supercomputers. Ultimately, this work seeks to increase parallel programming literacy so that users, whether novice or experienced, may leverage a world of ubiquitous parallelism to enhance productivity in all walks of life, including the sciences, engineering, commerce, and liberal arts.}

abstract = {As cities are developing to smart, new systems are utilized that contain a multitude of critical infrastructures. Although these offer major advantages, they are also exposed to new external and frequently uncontrollable factors increasing their risk exposure and enhancing their vulnerability. Therefore, increasing resilience during city development has become a prerequisite for its survival, but continuous resilience improvement led by workforce will help them to prosper. According to researchers, officers should be able to catalogue and prioritize threats and vulnerabilities, but is this only the case? Discrete studies detail and analyze in-depth risks related to smart cities, however, how these risks are addressed by workforce and how these are related to their competencies have not been thoroughly understood to date. If vulnerabilities are not understood and analyzed appropriately by the city workforce and stakeholders, unanticipated consequences and cascading failures may potential occur, even when crises are expected. The objective of this article is to inquire into responsibilities regarding crisis issues concerning the necessary competencies for resilience officers, by exploring current perceptions, expectations and recommendations as these are acknowledged in experts’ opinions and experiences. To do so, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to experts in the field, across various cities in Greece, to indicate responsibilities, and prioritize competencies that resilient officers in smart cities should possess. The findings highlighted significant responsibilities related to managing smart city risks and identified a distinct set of competencies unique to officers in this area, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to enhance urban resilience through the initiatives led by city officers. This article establishes a clear path for advancing smart city research by highlighting competencies that could be integrated into educational curriculums. These competencies are essential for training a workforce that not only enhances disaster management awareness but also equips cities to handle potential catastrophic events effectively, thereby laying the groundwork for more resilient urban environments.}

This syndrome, has gained a lot of attention due to its prevalence among children across all countries and from different economic backgrounds. However, ASD detection and treatment yet remains in its infancy due to the lack of awareness among parents, limited screening of proper developmental milestones and a dearth of diagnostic tools to classify this syndrome with convincing accuracy. Recent studies report that scalable biomarkers for early detection have made little progress in research due to the erraticism of this disorder. Moreover, the study on developing tools or applications for parents, teachers, and healthcare workers to identify children who exhibit any form of autism is still a work in progress. The research work undertaken in this paper presents an analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms on mining interesting details that link the diverse nature of ASD and the possibility of computationally detecting markers for the syndrome. The preliminary findings on the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms in ASD classification is reported with the possibility of integrating deep learning architectures for ASD detection and therapy.}

Creating an automation literacy from the Primary School's age is beneficial for pupils because it supports the development of valuable skills that allow the comprehension and analysis of real-world phenomena. Even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. What prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into K12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system.}

Traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals’ attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. This article introduces Colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. This article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of Colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. A multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. Users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the Hexad framework for gamification design. This study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within Colearnis. The findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. Additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers’ self-created knowledge. On the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. These findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. These systems could be further tailored to align with individuals’ managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission.}

From the resulting analysis of 49 studies, this study investigates the contextual characteristics by AI-supported interaction type, AI application, target language, educational level, etc. Moreover, three research paradigms are identified in this emerging field, i.e., Paradigm One (AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Three (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). The paradigms are induced through analysis of eight constructs: human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, cognitive outcome, and research focus. The philosophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm are discussed. Additionally, we highlight future research implications including investigating under-researched themes and exploring diverse methodological possibilities and appropriateness among the three research paradigms.}

In order to use IVR applications as an effective teaching and learning medium, it is important to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of this technology compared to other media. This raises the question of what type of learning environment is most effective in promoting specific knowledge and skills. To answer these questions, a systematic review of research on learning with IVR in an educational context was conducted using the PRISMA method (Liberati et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021). The study analyzed 30 relevant research articles to compare the relative effectiveness of IVR-based learning and its impact on learner engagement, as outlined in the ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014). The results indicate that IVR has a positive impact on learning compared to other types of media. The study suggests that IVR technology is suitable for learning environments that prioritize active learner engagement and practical application, such as active manipulation and constructive creation. In summary, the results offer more insights into the advantages of using IVR to accomplish particular learning objectives.}

This paper identifies the impact of computation delivered by authentic learning experiences in the form of anchored instruction on students' self-beliefs and their capacity to leverage computation to acquire disciplinary concepts in subsequent computationally-based engineering coursework. This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. Implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving.}

abstract = {The new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructor playing an advising and facilitating role. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babeş Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design. Not only does QLearn platform provide a smart learning environment for students, but it also ensures the knowledge transfer from instructors to students in an efficient and effective way.}

Through this single-case study design, the study examined the learning experiences of a group of teachers engaged in interactive, inquiry-based professional learning focused on math, making and coding during a shift to emergency remote teaching. The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions. This research suggests that online professional learning sessions need to consider three elements: the teacher, the content, and the learning environment and offers important recommendations for future work in this area.}

abstract = {Background
Marked advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies throughout industries, including healthcare, necessitate a broader understanding their use. Particularly, intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies and its predictors among nursing students, who are prospective healthcare professionals, is required to promote the utilization of AI.
Objective
This study conducted a path analysis to predict nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was performed.
Participants
The participants were 210 nursing students from two nursing schools in Korea.
Methods
This study established hypothetical paths for the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and anxiety on intent to use AI-based technologies. Mediation of positive and negative attitudes and facilitating conditions' direct effects on intent to use were examined.
Results
Positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.485, p = .009) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.117, p = .045) predicted intent to use, whereas the path from negative attitude to intent to use was not significant. Performance expectancy, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy predicted positive attitude. Performance expectancy and self-efficacy had a negative effect on the path to negative attitude, whereas anxiety had a positive effect. Facilitating conditions did not significantly predict positive or negative attitude and only directly predicted intent to use. Social influence did not have a significant effect on intent to use.
Conclusions
Intervention programs and other measures should be developed to provide education and information to boost performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and self-efficacy regarding the use of AI to lower anxiety and foster positive attitude toward AI-based health technologies.}

Teacher training institutions are faced with the central challenge of providing student teachers and teachers with adaptive learning opportunities for their competence in digital areas. In the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. The present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); language literature arts (LLA); and social sciences (SOCS). The questionnaire-based study examines student teachers' self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. Group comparisons show that STEM student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. Despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation.}

The results revealed that, first, female students were more likely to perform well in listening, talking, and integrating during class, and in the quality of posts after class, whereas male students tended to engage more in irrelevant behavior in collaboration. Second, same-gender groups were more active in collaborative discussion, but all-male groups performed worst in quality of posts after class. Third, both male and female students were more active in same-gender groups than in mixed groups. Finally, same-gender groups tended to have greater interpersonal connectedness than mixed-gender groups.

Computational pathology is burgeoning subspecialty in pathology that promises a better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, computational pathology faces several challenges, including the ability to integrate raw data from different sources, limitation of hardware processing capacity, and a lack of specific training programs, as well as issues on ethics and larger societal acceptable practices that are still solidifying. The establishment of the entire industry of computational pathology requires far-reaching changes of the three essential elements connecting patients and doctors: the local laboratory, the scan center, and the central cloud hub/portal for data processing and retrieval. Computational pathology, unlocked through information integration and advanced digital communication networks, has the potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality, and ultimately create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients.

Current efforts may significantly underestimate the role of data, the fundamental component of an AI system. If the goal is to enable students to understand how AI systems work, knowledge of key concepts related to data processing is a prerequisite, as data collection, preparation, and engineering are closely linked to the functionality of AI systems. To advance the field, the following research provides a comprehensive collection of key data-related concepts relevant to K-12 computer science education. These concepts were identified through a theoretical review of the AI field, aligned through a review of AI curricula for school education, evaluated through interviews with domain experts and teachers, and structured hierarchically according to the data lifecycle. Computer science educators can use the elaborated structure as a conceptual guide for designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to understand how AI systems are created and function.}

abstract = {Faced with a world of accelerating change and rapidly-evolving technology, education systems must provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. However, many countries have failed to incorporate the teaching of these skills within their schools. Our study therefore looks to portray teachers' understanding, strategies and obstacles in teaching these skills across Latin American classrooms. To do so, we analyzed the responses to an online survey from 1391 active teachers across 20 countries in the region. This revealed varying understandings of 21st century skills, with little common understanding. Most teachers failed to mention the skills included in the most popular framework (the 4 Cs); those who did reported using the same strategies, regardless of the skill being taught. These strategies included project-based learning, oracy activities, literacy strategies, and teamwork. We conclude that there is little or no common understanding around these skills, nor the best strategies for developing them. Our study helps understand the potential causes preventing the teaching of these skills in the classroom, a problem that extends beyond Latin America.}

The qualitative data is analysed using thematic content analysis. The results of this study reveal that more than half of the participants cannot adequately understand the one-dimensional motion graphs. These findings suggest that pre-service science teachers’ instructors should be aware of their students’ difficulties in understanding of kinematic graphs. Furthermore, teaching modules which will promote the pre-service science teachers’ understanding of kinematic graphs are designed and implemented.}

The findings revealed a longstanding emphasis on educational psychology, particularly motivation and achievement, rather than cross-curricular competencies and learner's well-being and socio-economic background. Notably, self-regulated learning (SRL) emerged as an overarching research subject in terms of motivation and achievement, but, surprisingly, not (meta)cognition. Prospects for the field build on cross-disciplinary research, theoretical refinement, and methodological advances. Further, the field is expected to maintain academic rigor, address diversity among learners, foster global collaboration, and focus on underprivileged populations.}

abstract = {Since its introduction, pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has been widely written about in the science education research literature. It has served as an alluring concept amongst many of the discussions on the teaching and learning of science. This paper reviews and draws together empirical research on a specific PCK lens, consisting of two tools: a Content Representation (CoRe) and Pedagogical and Professional Experiences Repertoires (PaP-eRs). Both tools were originally developed by Loughran et al. (2006) and have since been used by a variety of educational researchers and practitioners within their own contexts. This paper seeks to present how CoRes and PaP-eRs have helped conceptualise and advance PCK research, including the impact this has had on the professional practice of teachers. This paper, in so doing, also demonstrates how this PCK lens can facilitate effective teaching and learning in science education.
Resumen
Desde su aparición, la expresión conocimiento didáctico del contenido (PCK, por sus siglas en inglés) ha sido ampliamente citada en la literatura sobre investigación en las ciencias de la educación, y ha protagonizado muchos de los debates sobre la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de las ciencias. Este artículo revisa y perfila con una mirada específica los PCK, que constan de 2 herramientas: una representación del contenido (CoRe), y un repertorio de experiencias profesionales y pedagógicas (Pap-eRs). Ambas herramientas fueron desarrolladas originalmente por Loughran et al. (2006), y desde entonces han sido empleadas por muchos investigadores y docentes en su contexto particular. El objetivo del presente artículo es mostrar cómo el uso de CoRes y PaP-eRs ha ayudado a conceptualizar y avanzar en la investigación del PCK, incluyendo el impacto que este ha tenido en la práctica profesional de los docentes. Al hacerlo, también se muestra cómo el PCK puede facilitar una enseñanza y un aprendizaje eficaz en educación científica.}

But little is known about what they learn when programming a game. In this article, we present a strategy for coding student games, and summarize the results of an analysis of 108 games created by middle school girls using Stagecast Creator in an after school class. The findings show that students engaged in moderate levels of complex programming activity, created games with moderate levels of usability, and that the games were characterized by low levels of code organization and documentation. These results provide evidence that game construction involving both design and programming activities can support the learning of computer science concepts.}

Moreover, this loss of competencies can reduce their employment opportunities while society itself is deprived of that human capital. Remote laboratories have emerged as a way of countering the effects of insufficient investment in equipment or the inability to acquire the latter. By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics. Initial results are in the direction of certifying that student achievement and satisfaction are higher in rural than in urban environments.}

In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language. The supporting system is implemented in an applicative programming environment. Some elements of the supporting system were tested when developing applied information systems in the field of jurisprudence.}

Nowadays, car wash facilities give numerous car wash or car detailing services such as foam washing, waxing, and polishing, which are handy for consumers. However, there are certain limits revealed that customers must queue up for a long period till their turn. During busy hours, clients could have to wait for a few hours, which wastes customers’ time. Besides, it is problematic for people living in apartments because there is no place for them to wash their cars. Other than that, most individuals are frightened to leave their homes because worried about the COVID-19 virus. Hence, the recommended solutions in this application can address the issues by integrating the booking system while being online. The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) has been used as a methodology for the entire research, including all phases except the deployment and maintenance phases. The purpose of this research is to make it more convenient for the user by providing door-to-door vehicle wash services at shopping malls, parking lots, places of employment, residential driveways, and other locations.}

If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. Moreover, I point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of CLT is often not engaged with or addressed.}

In each of the classrooms a small number of computers and an interactive whiteboard (IWB) were utilised. This paper uses a case study approach to describe how engagement with Scratch and independent use of the IWB enabled children to work collaboratively to solve design challenges. Initial results indicate that the Scratch program is engaging for children. It created an environment where the children were, by necessity, using problem-solving processes such as goal setting, and generating and testing of ideas. The interactive whiteboard afforded rich opportunities for children to collaborate and share their thinking.

AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.}

Given that COVID-19 has transitioned from pandemic to endemic, it is an opportune time to retrospect the contributions of related research to shape the future of management education. Using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a systematic literature review was conducted on management education research relating to COVID-19 published between 2020 and 2022. A total of 56 relevant articles were found in and retrieved from the Web of Science database and subsequently analyzed using descriptive and content analyses. The descriptive analysis revealed a steep increase in research on the impact of COVID-19 on management education over time, with most research appearing in The International Journal of Management Education. The contributions came from various countries, with the top five being the USA, the UK, Australia, India, and China. The content analysis showed that most research adopted empirical methodologies while self-determination theory emerged as the most popular theoretical lens for study. The related research revolved around five major themes—i.e., digital teaching and learning, collaboration and partnership, embracing uncertainty and building resilience, transformation and innovation, and developing an entrepreneurial mindset—and provided implications for management education in the new normal, wherein the priority is focused on enhancing education quality and preparing future business leaders for profound challenges in the new normal, thereby necessitating the development of innovative pedagogies and leadership competencies.}

Early education has a huge impact on the further development of children, so preschool teachers must be competent and use appropriate teaching and educational methods. In this study, the development of self-directed learning (SDL) of future preschool teachers is investigated by considering two variables, namely the type of study (full-time and part-time students) and the learning modalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-, during and post-COVID-19 confinement). We collected data from 418 participants and analysed them using descriptive statistics, 2 × 3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a two-step cluster analysis. The results show the status of pre-service preschool teachers' perceptions of their SDL development and how the variables influenced it. There were significant differences in the students' self-reported SDL skills, depending on the learning environment and the type of study. The status indicator helps educators identify and change the curriculum and how they work with students. It allows the faculty to highlight the positive aspects of the different educational modalities encountered, as well as the characteristics of the study types and their impact on the learning process to improve students’ SDL skills. The results of the study may help in the design of tailored metacognitive scaffolds that take into account different modalities. Further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of digital open learning environments that address both SDL and preschool educational practices.}

Office Madness was designed taking into account both educational games for programming and entertainment games, as well as the EFM design model. The main goal of the study presented is to investigate the impact of a game using a real life job and programming scenario on player experience and short-term learning. One hundred and seventy-four final-year students of an Informatics Department play-tested the game and provided feedback through an online questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model.

Afterwards, the conceptual design of the IoT-Lab – attracting three target groups (high school students, undergraduates and graduates as well as representatives of industry) and including a strong focus to action-oriented learning – will be presented in detail. Each workshop covers design and production of the housing – using additive manufacturing –, the sensor and / or circuit configuration, the programming process and integration into the IoT-Labs’ or any other network system.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence into education has emerged as a promising avenue for enriching teaching and learning experiences. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of artificial intelligence in educational contexts hinges upon various factors, one of which is the perspective of instructors. With this in mind, this study aimed to examine the perspectives of 536 instructors in STEM and non-STEM disciplines regarding AI integration. The respondents’ thoughts, opinions, and concerns regarding advantages, disadvantages and challenges were gathered through an online questionnaire featuring both closed and open-ended questions. Additionally, a series of semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with a cohort of instructors to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that both STEM and non-STEM instructors expressed positive attitudes toward the integration of AI technologies into education. However, notable differences in responses and concerns were also identified in relation to the perceived capabilities and limitations of AI technologies within educational contexts. The results further elucidated a spectrum of opinions on the benefits (e.g., scalability and tirelessness), drawbacks (e.g., deepfake technology and comfort-seeking behavior), and potential challenges (e.g., educational disillusionment and espionage) associated with AI integration. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for STEM and non-STEM education and offering recommendations for the effective and ethical integration of AI technologies in classrooms.}

However, this literature is dominated by game-play approaches, rather than game-making approaches. Drawing upon constructivist, motivation, dual-coding, and constructionist theories, this study examined elementary English language learners’ vocabulary learning experiences in a game-based learning context and investigated their experience as they built their own games based on their understanding of different non-fiction texts. This mixed-methods case study involved novel use of network analysis to examine student learning, investigate the relationships between various aspects of learner experiences, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. Findings indicated that a complex set of interdependencies between enactments of theoretical principles including generativity, agency, tinkering, intrinsic motivation, and contextualized learning lead to enjoyment and powerful language learning experiences. Design principles for future digital game-based language learning include optimizing visual aspects, spending more time on technical skill development, increasing learner agency, and focusing more on generative and joyful learning experiences.}

abstract = {Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%.}

It reflects on the value that is promised for tertiary education, teaching, and learning. Separating hype from the realistic possibilities, the connections between advances in technology, policy, and development challenges are critically examined to consider how the 4IR could impact on tertiary education, and teaching and learning, in the future. It then proceeds to examine the enabling conditions which need to be cultivated at national, institutional, and individual levels, and the challenges and obstacles to be overcome at these levels, for enduring benefits to be realized. The paper explores what the phenomenon of the 4IR is, drawing on the arguments of key proponents, including skeptics. It explores what kinds of changes are envisaged as the phenomenon progresses. It then proceeds to examine how institutions may be positioned to harness the 4IR for the benefit of human wellbeing, and in support of national and international social and economic benefits. The promise of the 4IR to resolve our developmental challenges has been sharply questioned—perhaps being overhyped, given existing and enduring disadvantage and marginalization that was not ameliorated in previous industrial revolutions. These are elaborated upon. At the institutional level, more sophisticated use of digital technology is called for—in administration, teaching, learning support, and e-learning. Online data and information management; aggregation of vast amounts of data; and analyses of data for student success and student support promise a positive impact on success and throughput rates. Key imperatives for action include redesigning, streamlining, and aligning the education system. This requires flexibility in admission criteria, curriculum design, learning and teaching modes, and assessment, with appropriate support systems and services across the institution.}

Despite findings suggesting various benefits of social robot use in schools, clinics, and homes, stakeholders have voiced concerns about the potential social and emotional effects of children engaging in long-term interactions with robots. Given the challenges of conducting large long-term studies of child-robot interaction (CRI), little is known about the impact of CRI on children’s socio-emotional development. Here we summarize the literature on predictions and expectations of teachers, parents, therapists, and children regarding the effects of CRI on children’s socio-emotional functioning and skill building. We then highlight the limited body of empirical research examining how CRI affects children’s social behavior and emotional expression, and we provide a summary of available questionnaires for measuring socio-emotional constructs relevant to CRI. We conclude with design recommendations for research studies aimed at better understanding the effects of CRI, before social robots become ubiquitous. This review is relevant to researchers, educators, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots with developmental populations.}

Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.}

It is suggested that a much broader education is required in cyber-physical system (CPS) than has traditionally been the case for degree and masters' level students. CPS developers will need to be knowledgeable about natural, applied and social sciences. The curriculum for a TCPS engineer emerges as a vast range of knowledge requirements and it is suggested that ideally students will graduate with a T-shaped curriculum vitae that provides for a broad knowledge of many subjects and a deep knowledge in one or two. Studies into the appropriate curriculum for CPS have been conducted since the early 2000s, but it is noted that many of these failed to give adequate weight to ethics and topics in the social sciences. A framework for TCPS graduate and postgraduate education is provided: delivery of the curriculum must ensure students are taught in a transdisciplinary manner and develop an holistic approach to TCPS development and operation.}

The study focuses on the Maker mindsets transformation of three students with varying abilities, deliberately chosen as information-rich participants. A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives. These findings carry significant implications for educators, advocating for the implementation of customized strategies, authentic contextualization, structured methodologies, and collaborative frameworks to holistically nurture Maker mindsets evolution. Moreover, our study underscores the practicality of the LS approach in fostering collaborative development of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering Maker mindsets formation.}

This study explores the impacts of Connect Science, a service-learning (SL) program developed to enhance elementary students' energy literacy in the United States. Program impacts were explored within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers in the SL intervention group were provided with professional development, coaching and curricular materials. Each fourth grade class chose an energy problem to address, and designed projects to test out a solution. Teachers in a waitlist control group taught their typical energy unit. Upon completion of the unit, students were asked to write about a problem related to energy production or use and propose a potential solution. Inductive content analysis was used to code 703 student responses (377 from control group and 326 from SL group). The majority of students expressed concerns about wasting or using too much electricity or the use of nonrenewable energy sources. Solutions focused on energy conservation and the use of renewable or clean resources were mentioned most frequently overall. Students in the SL group were significantly more likely to mention environmental impacts of various energy sources and to suggest energy conservation solutions or educating others. Conversely, the control group student responses more often focused on electric circuits or electrical safety. Results from this study suggest the promise of environmental SL programs to advance energy literacy and promote critical thinking about how to address energy problems.}

Due to the numerous types of distortions and unclarified distortion-structure relations, a quantitative distortion manipulation for the desired crystalline phase of perovskite materials suitable for various application remains challenging. Here, by establishing parameter sets to systematically describe the types, magnitudes and positional relations involved in distortions, we are able to interpret the structural regulations and manipulation strategies in 7 reported crystal systems. Through the construction of distortion-phase-property functional curves, we further propose a paradigm to quantify the structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phases. Using the example of perovskite-like tungsten oxides, we successfully quantify their volume shrinkage and symmetry increase during lithiation. This work verifies that the complicated research and development of perovskite materials can be simplified into a mathematical problem solving process, which will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to participate, especially mathematicians and computer scientists.}

Less is known, however, about how programming games afford learning and playing by design. To address this, we performed a qualitative, comparative analysis of 19 programming games from an instructional and game attributes perspective. The findings showed that a majority of programming games presents only a moderate alignment with established instructional principles. Furthermore, significant differences in the presence and prevalence of their game attributes were found. Our analysis resulted in a systematic classification of programming games according to their alignment with instructional principles and their positioning on a playing-versus-programming spectrum. Informed by this twofold classification, we explored whether particular programming games can still be conceptualized as games, as opposed to learning or programming environments. Accordingly, we formulated opportunities and restrictions towards their potential context-of-use.}
