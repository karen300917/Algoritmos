abstract = {In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.}

abstract = {Digital literacy and respective education are of growing interest in our increasingly digitalized world. Recent works stress the importance of aiming beyond the acquisition of corresponding technical competences and call for fostering children’s empowerment and participation in digitalization. Computational Empowerment (CE) pursues that goal through a creative and reflexive participatory design approach. However, remaining conceptual vagueness with regard to what CE entails may hinder its implementation in formal education. This paper addresses this gap, with the aim to demonstrate what is needed to advance CE’s position in this context. To this end, we elaborate on our understanding of CE’s vision, approach and impact. We then examine CE in the context of formal education, and contrast it with selected contemporary educational theory and practice. Specifically, we position CE in relation to an established learning framework (Bloom’s revised taxonomy), educational policy (DigComp) and practices in the classroom. This is complemented by an analysis of four different projects: we present lessons learned in the context of pedagogical interventions and take a closer look at the accompanying empowerment processes. As a result, this paper provides a foundation to make CE’s ideas more tangible and, thus, actionable, for researchers, policy makers and educators.}

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated high achievers in primary school programming classes. This study adapted the hedonic-motivation system adoption model to identify high achievers' perceived attitudes, flow experience, programming intentions and perceived teacher support. With a response rate of 72%, 54 primary schools participated in the study. A survey was conducted and four hundred and thirty-two students were included in the moderated mediation analysis. The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes. The practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.}

To find out the reasons for this we have launched the TAaAS project (Testing Algorithmic and Application Skills), which focuses on the students’ algorithmic skills and programming ability in traditional and non-traditional programming environments. Our analyses proved that school leaving exams are not able to measure these abilities of the students, and beyond that, are not able to distinguish between the different levels of the students.

To address this issue, this study aimed to explore South Korean elementary school teachers' experiences teaching AI curricula and examine their competencies. A survey and interviews were conducted with 67 elementary school teachers who have been working in AI-leading schools in South Korea. The results indicated that teachers were least confident in content knowledge, followed by technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge relevant to AI. Additionally, interviews with 13 teachers revealed five themes regarding AI education: (1) emphasizing the importance of instructional design in AI education; (2) redesigning the learning environment to promote learning experiences; (3) lowering teaching anxiety by acknowledging the limitations of content knowledge; (4) extending AI education based on computer science (CS) principles; and (5) acquiring literacy in codes, data, AI technologies, and ethical issues. Based on the findings, 22 AI competencies for elementary school teachers were derived and categorized based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The competencies provide a practical framework for teachers to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for AI education. The study contributes to understanding AI teaching practices in South Korea by revealing teachers’ perspectives on and identifying the essential competencies for practicing AI education.}

We provide an understanding of the state of the art concerning open source tools for urban planning from journal articles, software repositories, and social media. Our search documented 70 open source tools that support different stages of the urban planning process. We cover an additional set of 54 peripheral tools to support domains related to urban planning. In the process, we formalise and describe the urban planning process and find that the entire planning process can be conducted using open source software. Tools focusing on street networks and geographic spatial analysis are the mainstay of current implementation. Sixty percent of tools are only accessible through an application programming interface, while 43% rely on Python for development. The scenario planning, public participation, and evaluation phases of the planning process present many untapped opportunities for open source software development. Findings will help urban planners and researchers to employ these tools for professional practice, and assist software developers to identify opportunities for software development in urban research.}

In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies.

However, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. In this way, NetsBlox offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.}

A quasi-experimental design was employed in this study. The participants consisted of 180 students taking general courses at a university in southern Taiwan. Instruments included the Test of Basic Programming Concept and a self-efficacy questionnaire. The results indicated that the VPL teaching improved learners' understanding of basic programming concepts in the experimental group. The effect on basic programming concepts was especially large in students with moderate and low self-efficacy.

In this study, the reverse engineering pedagogy (REP) was applied to primary school students’ robotics education course, with the aim of investigating the influence of REP and project-based pedagogy (PBP) on the cultivation of students' creativity. A quasi-experimental study that utilized a non-equivalent groups design was conducted with 91 fifth-grade students, comprising a control group (n = 46) who received the PBP intervention, and an intervention group (n = 45) who received the REP intervention. Creative self-efficacy, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking Figural (TTCT-Figural), and assessment of the students’ robotic creative products were conducted to evaluate students’ creativity. In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity. The findings of this study provide a reference and teaching strategies guidance for the cultivation of K-12 students' creativity in robotics education.}

Leveraging this, we extracted the emotions based upon two different theoretical frameworks from videos with children aged 13–16 while collaborating to create games using Scratch. The two sets of emotions are based on the control value theory (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) and the education-specific expressions (frustration, boredom, confusion, delight). We computed the groups’ objective performance, which was calculated based on their created artifacts. We divided them into high and low performance and compared them based on individual emotions’ duration and the transitions among the emotions. We also used the subjective indication of their perceived performance from a self-reported questionnaire, divided them into another performance category, and did a similar analysis with the objective performance. Results show that the objective performance is better explained by the education-specific emotions and the negative valance emotions from the control value theory-based emotions. On the other hand, subjective performance is better explained by the control value theory based on emotions. Based on the results, we suggest implications both for the instructors and students.}

This new user-centered paradigm — known as the NUI — aims to provide a more natural and rich experience to end users; this supports its adoption in many ubiquitous domains, as it naturally holds for Pervasive Displays: these systems are composed of variously-sized displays and support many-to-many interactions with the same public screens at the same time. Due to their public and moderated nature, users need an easy way of adapting them to heterogeneous usage contexts in order to support their long-term adoption. In this paper, we propose an End-User Development approach to this problem introducing TAPAS, a system that combines a tangible interaction with a puzzle metaphor, allowing users to create workflows on a Pervasive Display to satisfy their needs; its design and visual syntax stem from a study we carried out with designers, whose findings are also part of this work. We then carried out a preliminary evaluation of our system with second year university students and interaction designers, gathering useful feedback to improve TAPAS and employ it in many other domains.}

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.}

On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 30 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e., know and understand, use and apply, evaluate and create, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.}

To evaluate the current state of the literature on AI literacy in higher and adult education, a scoping literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying thematic foci and recent research trends. Ten research databases were searched and out of 902 initial records, 30 studies were identified using predefined eligibility criteria, whereof the content was evaluated in the review. The results indicated that research in this area is still in its infancy and needs refinement in terms of how to define AI literacy in adult education as well as what content should be taught to non-experts. Lastly, several recommendations for research and practice are derived from the results.}

Spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. We examined middle school students’ representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. Task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). Findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. By contrast, Low and Average Spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. A novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. From a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence.}

This exploratory study engaged teams of elementary and middle school students in the collaborative design of digital games. Game design is theoretically examined in this study as a form of knowledge-creating learning that is characterized by collaborative efforts to advance a shared object of activity, i.e., the game being designed. Using mixed methods, we examined how students experienced the game design project and how the project fostered connected learning, that is, integration of students’ personal interests and supportive peer relations with their schoolwork, and how their self-assessed digital competences developed.
Methods
The digital competences of 98 comprehensive school students across Finland were traced using pre- and post-questionnaires. The post-questionnaire also included validated measures on connected learning. Quantitative methods were used to analyze structured measures, and qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended measures.
Findings
Students experienced game design as an inspiring, challenging activity. Game design engaged student teams in sustained, collaborative efforts to create shared digital artifacts. Their efforts involved a great deal of mutual support and knowledge sharing. Participation also improved students’ self-reported technical and artistic digital competences. The game design project fostered informal, interest-driven, sociodigital participation; inspired learning engagement; and improved schoolwork practices.
Contribution
The game design project appeared to be a pedagogically meaningful way of engaging students in knowledge-creating learning and of connecting students' formal and informal learning. The project sparked students’ motivation to learn, fostered digital competences, and enriched the learning environment.}

abstract = {Concerning the marginalization of computer science education in K-12 STEM education in the United States, this study examined the extent to which taking more credits in computer science courses at the secondary level predicts students' STEM major choices in postsecondary institutions in the U.S., by comparison to the well-documented predictors of students' STEM major choices after controlling for student demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, SES, and racial background). These predictors include credits earned in math and science courses as well as ACT math scores. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of U.S. young adults who were 12th graders in 2004 and disclosed their college majors by 2006, logistic regression analyses revealed that students who took more units in computer science courses were significantly more likely to choose STEM majors in both 4-year and 2-year postsecondary institutions. Moreover, regardless of the type of postsecondary institutions that students attended, taking more units in computer science courses played a significant role in choosing STEM majors. In addition, the effects of computer science education on student STEM major selection were equally as strong as the effects of math and science education. The results suggest that promoting the quality of computer science education is just as important in motivating students to pursue STEM education and career choices at the secondary level as are math and science education.}

Sample preparation conditions and method performance were evaluated. Precision ranged from 1% to 10% for beer and 2–12% for gin, accuracy from 84 % to 118% for beer and 10–124% for gin. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for beer ranged from 0.04 to 6 µg/L and 0.1–19 µg/L respectively. LOD and LOQ for gin ranged from 0.02 to 2.3 µg/L and 0.05–7.5 µg/L respectively. In addition, the stability of selected terpenoids (as class representatives) was assessed in a synthetic beer using a targeted and non-targeted approach at various temperatures (4, 25 and 50C) over 40 days. The optimized method was successfully applied to commercial craft beers (n = 34) and gins (n = 21). The main contributors to the beer profile were β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, and geraniol, and for gin 1,8-cineole, cis-rose oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, valencene, and citronellol. This first report of such a large number of terpenoids determined in one run and quantified using authentic standards can make a significant contribution to the knowledge of products that require a fast and accurate terpenoid screening method.}

Yet little is still known about the design features, implementation, and outcomes of professional development programs in computing. The purpose of this study is threefold: (a) examine a CS professional development program built around high-quality design features reported in the research literature, (b) investigate the impact of the program on participating teachers’ learning and classroom practice, and (c) identify specific design features that facilitated changes in teacher learning and practice. The study employed a mixed-methods design. Data were collected from multiple sources including, pre and post survey data on teacher knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology (N = 94), as well as interviews and classroom implementation data from eight case study participants. Findings from this work indicated that participants reported improvements in their knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology. They also applied new learning into their practice, though implementation varied among participants. Responding on the value of the professional development design features, teachers noted the importance of focusing on CS content knowledge as well as opportunities to engage with pedagogical practices for teaching computing. Findings also indicated the important role of contextualized follow-up classroom support in the implementation of new learning into practice. These findings have implications for the design of professional development programs grounded in best practices with the potential to support broad efforts intended to prepare teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to deliver CS education.}

abstract = {As software interfaces become more intuitive and require less technical expertise, the robotic arm is not only becoming a tool for automating bespoke construction, it is becoming a tool to help bring the concept of the “Master Builder” back to the architectural profession. Being analogous to a human arm, it is easy to imagine limitless possibilities the robotic arm. However, understanding and utilizing it for the purpose of construction requires more knowledge than just imagining it as prosthetic. Besides a fundamental understanding of the digital workflow from the initial design based data (3D modelling) to machine understandable data (proprietary output code), it requires the design and conception of the robot's physical environment from the tool at the end of its arm (end effector) to its physical surroundings(work cell). Contemporary software tools provide the capabilities for manufacturing purposes and allow for virtual simulations of the production process, ensuring higher rates of success for construction. It is the crossover between the virtual environment and the physical world that will empower architects of the future to reclaim the title of master builders as they will be required to not only comprehend but design and participate in the entire building process inclusive of the manufacturing of components. This paper outlines a pedagogical framework to introduce the multi-layered levels of knowledge to students of architecture that will allow them to use a 6-axis robotic arm for the purpose of automated construction, making them aware of a new and complex building process that will be integral to redefining architecture in the near future.}

Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field. Finally, a 1:1:1 -model for realising research-based suggestions in PD programmes is presented.}

However, apart from this beneficial effect, increased levels of population mean set-point viral load (SPVL), an estimator for HIV virulence, have been observed in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the decade following the introduction of ART in The Netherlands. Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail. In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART. The results suggest that sexual risk behaviour has an effect on SPVL and indicate that more data are needed to test the effect of STI co-factors on SPVL. Furthermore, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only. We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to viral evolution as reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more data for parameter estimation than what is currently available.}

abstract = {Job market is increasingly demanding jobs in all fields of Computer science. Besides that, most jobs require computer literacy and computer fluency. Students should get these skills through elementary education. In the Republic of Croatia computer science is part of informatics course which is elective course for students from 5th to 8th grade. Because of that, students have to be motivated to elect such course. To investigate motivation and attitude towards elective course of informatics we conducted survey among 1462 8th grade elementary students as a special form of non-experimental research. Results of the research is presented in this paper.}

We introduce some key definitions of 21st century skills, outline international initiatives dedicated to advancing them, and present two examples of national curricular developments emphasizing and integrating these. Next, we present some examples of projects illustrating the interrelationship between assessment, education and technological development. Last, we introduce some perspectives on the assessment and transformation of education that point toward opportunities and pitfalls for the future. Our analysis shows that while there are a number of ongoing initiatives dedicated to developing instruments and curricula for assessment of 21st century skills, there are also fundamental challenges for the development of relevant assessments on a systemic level and for transforming practices related to 21st century skills more broadly. The lack of representation from several parts of the world, in international assessment initiatives on 21st century skills, is also striking. By taking a meta-perspective, we identify evolving themes within this field and provide a critical perspective on these developments. We conclude there are a number of opportunities and pitfalls for creating good synergies between 21st century skills in curricula and practices, as well as for developing assessment strategies.}

Drawing on the TPD@Scale model, we systematically analyzed the quality, equity, and efficiency dimensions of 37 technology-enabled TPD programs implemented during the pandemic. The findings demonstrate that technology-enabled TPD programs could develop teachers’ knowledge and skills critical to quality teaching during the pandemic and create environments that foster active learning and collaboration among teachers. However, there needs to be significant improvements in using technology to provide expert support and facilitate feedback and reflections. Furthermore, equity and efficiency were not specifically discussed in these TPD programs. Lessons learned from the present study have allowed us to provide recommendations to researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and educators.}

As a case study, a method of how to map learning data onto learners’ cognitive and metacognitive was proposed based on an analysis of a number of pupils’ Scratch projects. Three mapping table were established. Pupil’s cognitive skill could be evaluated from technology shown from Scratch project, namely, data structure, algorithm, computational practices and overall evaluation. Content shown from Scratch project were used to infer pupil’s cognitive style. Meta-cognitive ability can be measured from computational practices and behavior in programming process.}

abstract = {This paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.}

This article looks at how students organize the use of different artifacts when creating computer games about historical topics. The data informing this article consist of video data collected from one sixth-grade class and one seventh-grade class in Norway. A sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the artifacts are given different epistemic status. The students jointly construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, Google, and timelines. The article shows how designing games about historical topics is a complex process in which students use artifacts as the basis for knowledge claims and storytelling, and students need to negotiate and balance their own design preferences with historical accuracy and the expectations of the classroom setting.}

Increasingly, these environments are moving into the “cloud” where they can be accessed through web browsers and run on a variety of devices including tablets and smartphones. The shift to online settings enables a variety of powerful pedagogical features to be incorporated into the design of these learning environments, including making it easy to share learner-authored programs, browse projects written by others, and allow learners to incorporate various Internet resources into their work. Further, the Internet itself can serve as a productive canvas upon which novice programmers can create in the form of dynamic and interactive web pages. This shift in venue for authoring and editing programs is particularly well-suited for young learners growing up in an increasingly online world. In this paper, we present theoretical and practical arguments for online introductory programming environments as powerful learning tools and present data showing various ways young learners take advantage of features of the environment enabled by being situated online. In particular, the paper looks at how the online context can support young learners in authoring programs and interacting with programs authored by others. The contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of how the Internet can be utilized as a resource to situate learning and serve as an inviting and accessible pathway into computing.}

abstract = {The scaling up of antiretroviral therapy services over the past decades has led to a remarkable reduction in HIV infections and HIV-related deaths in South Africa (SA). While this is a step in the right direction, it brings a new public health challenge into focus, namely psychological challenges associated with such chronic and often stigmatising condition in SA, home to the largest HIV epidemic. Given the current lack of national-level evidence, we investigated the role of the HIV epidemic on depression onset in SA using nationally representative panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (SA-NIDS). Our incident cohort consisted of 13,020 sampled adult participants who were depression-free in Wave 4 (baseline year of 2015). We then measured the risk of depression onset in Wave 5 (year 2017) based on the level of HIV prevalence in the community where study participants resided at baseline. A High-resolution map of HIV spatial heterogeneity (i.e., community HIV prevalence) was generated using ordinary kriging mapping methods from a separate nationally representative data source that corresponded to the investigation period. Geospatial analyses were conducted to identify the spatial structure of HIV and depression onset, and generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression models were fitted to determine the risk of depression onset over time based on community HIV prevalence. Our geospatial analyses indicated that HIV and depression onset prevalence spatially overlapped in the eastern part of the country, particularly in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Free State province. The GEE regression analyses indicated that individual residency in a community with high HIV prevalence was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression than a low HIV prevalence community (adjusted odds ratio =1.45, 95% CI=1.12-1.48). For the first time, we identified a geospatial overlap between HIV and depression, with a greater risk of depression onset in high HIV prevalence communities, at a national scale in SA. There is a need for place-based policy interventions that prioritise the availability of and access to mental health services in high HIV prevalent SA communities, in an ageing HIV epidemic.}

Lack of effective teaching modalities that can leverage real-world examples to stimulate student interest in STEM concepts are identified as one of the reasons for this crisis. To address these challenges, our research is investigating the use of innovative and attractive modeling and simulation frameworks for concurrent, interactive and collaborative STEM education where vehicular traffic serves as the real-world example to reify STEM concepts. Existing traffic-related tools, such as traffic simulators, however, do not provide: (1) intuitive abstractions to construct, refine, and simulate various traffic models that are commensurate to the level of high school students, (2) concurrent and scalable model execution, and (3) collaborative learning environments. On the other hand, although intuitive abstractions such as Google Maps exist, these abstractions do not support semantics for dynamic behavior, which is representative of real-world traffic scenarios. To overcome both these challenges and address the STEM problem, this paper presents a Cloud-based, Collaborative, and Scaled-up Modeling and Simulation Framework for STEM Education called C2SuMo. The key contribution of this paper lies in the design and implementation of a cloud-based, elastic modeling and simulation framework that provides an intuitive, model-driven, collaborative, and concurrent visual simulation environment for STEM education. The paper also reports on insights we gained conducting a user study involving over sixty high school students.}

Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes.}

A data object is an object identified by standard methods, including the network identifiers URI, URL and URN. The data objects can be either atomic or have a complex structure, including links to other objects, and this ensures the linking of objects into a network, which can be considered as an information graph. It turns out to be possible to formulate a number of criteria for supporting the integrity of such a structure; the paper proposes language tools to formulate such criteria. An essential feature of this network is the dependence of the objects’ information content on a number of parameters, first of all, on time. Depending on the parameter, the information content of the object can change both with the preservation of the integrity of the structure, and with its damage. The paper considers methods for a parameterized description of objects while maintaining integrity based on the formalism of category theory. The formalization used allows defining two relations between objects and their names (identifiers): access and links. The paper studies the basic properties of such relations and reveals the differences between them. Category theoretical means of describing objects require appropriate support tools for practical application. The paper proposes a configuration of support tools for a network of links to parameterized data objects based on a combination of conceptual modeling tools and applicative computing tools. The proposed tools provide basic methods of access to the network of information graphs. An essential feature of the proposed tools is the ability to determine the subjective way of considering the information graph (based on the category of correlations), as well as harmonizing an objective and subjective way of considering. The proposed tools were tested in the development of applied information systems in the field of implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).}

abstract = {Learning analytics uses large amounts of data about learner interactions in digital learning environments to understand and enhance learning. Although measurement is a central dimension of learning analytics, there has thus far been little research that examines links between learning analytics and assessment. This special issue of Computers in Human Behavior highlights 11 studies that explore how links between learning analytics and assessment can be strengthened. The contributions of these studies can be broadly grouped into three categories: analytics for assessment (learning analytic approaches as forms of assessment); analytics of assessment (applications of learning analytics to answer questions about assessment practices); and validity of measurement (conceptualization of and practical approaches to assuring validity in measurement in learning analytics). The findings of these studies highlight pressing scientific and practical challenges and opportunities in the connections between learning analytics and assessment that will require interdisciplinary teams to address: task design, analysis of learning progressions, trustworthiness, and fairness – to unlock the full potential of the links between learning analytics and assessment.}

Recurrent disease outbreaks caused by a range of emerging and resurging pathogens over the past decade reveal major gaps in public health preparedness, detection, and response systems in Africa. Underlying causes of recurrent disease outbreaks include inadequacies in the detection of new infectious disease outbreaks in the community, in rapid pathogen identification, and in proactive surveillance systems. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of zoonotic outbreaks occur, there remains the perennial risk of outbreaks of new or re-emerging pathogens for which no vaccines or treatments are available. As the Ebola virus disease, COVID-19, and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks highlight, a major paradigm shift is required to establish an effective infrastructure and common frameworks for preparedness and to prompt national and regional public health responses to mitigate the effects of future pandemics in Africa.}

Phase 1 consisted of the design of the Flipped PARSER (problem-attempt-research-solutions-evaluation-reflect) Model (FPM) through the study of documentation and research. Phase 2 involved using nine experts to assist with the model's development and evaluation using in-depth interviews and content analysis. Phase 3 involved the application and use of the FPM by 30 student-teachers, from which their AA, PSS, and satisfaction were evaluated against the control group of 31 participants. The results from the nine experts' input on the FPM design were significant. Instructor activities included selecting content, media, materials, and their design and development. Other components included learning activities, tools, lesson delivery, and evaluation. Also, PBL methods were again confirmed as an instrumental pedagogy in teaching PSS. When combined with online learning and flipped classrooms, the study's results were higher than those using traditional classroom methods. The study contributes to the literature by determining that online teaching models effectively teach PSS and raise AA scores.}

But, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist.}

The growing trend of orienting technological innovation in the building sector towards the eco-efficiency of industrial manufacturing processes increasingly requires to identify methods and tools able to support the design/manufacturing/construction process as a whole. In this sense, the intellectual and operational dimension of design is discovering a new digital and data-driven technological paradigm. Digital tools are pushing the investigation of the building component manufacturing process into an increasingly virtual dimension, in which the constant integration between environmental and material/geometric parameters identifies the meta-design phase as the “ideal place” to experiment the creative use of data and technical knowledge. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates an original design methodology and the related digital/parametric workflow aimed at optimizing performances and production of a façade shading system realized in UHPFRC (Ultra High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete). The workflow described in this paper includes all the constraints arising from production and the assembly aspects of the components and, with the support of genetic algorithms, aims to improve indoor thermal comfort and indoor daylight performance while containing costs.}

Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.}

Computational data-centric research techniques play a prevalent and multi-disciplinary role in life science research. In the past, scientists in wet labs generated the data, and computational researchers focused on creating tools for the analysis of those data. Computational researchers are now becoming more independent and taking leadership roles within biomedical projects, leveraging the increased availability of public data. We are now able to generate vast amounts of data, and the challenge has shifted from data generation to data analysis. Here we discuss the pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities facing the field of data-centric research in biology. We discuss the evolving perception of computational data-driven research and its rise as an independent domain in biomedical research while also addressing the significant collaborative opportunities that arise from integrating computational research with experimental and translational biology. Additionally, we discuss the future of data-centric research and its applications across various areas of the biomedical field.}

We describe our design process, present the final proposal, reflect on the usefulness of such tools for early-stage design, and discuss implications for future research and practice. By analysing the results from training the text-to-text generators we could establish a specific design brief that informed the final concept. The results from the image-to-image generator gave an overview of the shape grammars of previous submissions. All results were intriguing and can assist creativity and in this way, the tools were useful for gaining insight into historical architectural data, helped shape a specific design brief, and provoked new ideas. By reflecting on our design process, we argue that the use of language when employing such tools takes a new role and that three layers of language intertwined in our work: architectural discourse, programming languages, and annotations.

abstract = {Background
There is an alarming trend in sub-Saharan Africa in the use of codeine-containing pharmaceuticals, but its risk of common comorbidities, such as mental health, remains unquantified at a national-level. We investigated the relationship between codeine use and onset of depression in South Africa at a population-level.
Methods
We used nationally representative panel data from the South Africa National Income Dynamic Study to investigate the relationship between exposure to codeine use in the community (i.e. residing in a codeine hotspot) and onset of depression. Geographical hotspots of codeine use were identified using Kulldorff spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. We quantified depression onset at Wave 5 (year 2017) between individuals residing inside and outside a codeine hotspot who were depression-free at enrolment (Wave 4: 2015) using generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models.
Results
We identified four statistically significant hotspots of codeine use, mostly located at the northern part of the country. Among 13,020 participants who were depression-free at enrolment, residing within a codeine use hotspot was significantly associated with higher subsequent onset of depression (aRR=1.21, 95% CI:1.08-1.44).
Limitations
Data on diagnosis of depressive disorder were not available.
Conclusion
South Africa, a resource scarce nation with chronically limited mental health services, is not spared from the global opioid epidemic and its impact on depression. Targeted scale-up access to agonist therapy to effectively treat (opioid) addiction in communities at risk for high exposure to codeine use could reduce the risk of subsequent mental health challenges.}

However, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. Within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. It, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. By presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being.}

Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games’ interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children’s comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities.}

Finally, this paper shows the growth in the number of students who enrolled in engineering degrees thanks to these dissemination activities.}

abstract = {Maker activities are drawing increasing attention in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students' learning outcomes. However, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. To fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. We systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. Our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and LilyPad Arduino being the most popular. Five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students' diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. Most assessments are used in STEM-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure STEM-related learning outcomes. Only 15% of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future research which include developing more low-tech maker activities for students in lower-grades and with lower technology proficiency. In addition, future studies should improve rubrics for artifact assessment and explore more assessment tools for non-STEM subjects.}

abstract = {Despite the documented number of studies that investigate social media in teaching and learning settings, the topic of social media literacy is still an under-researched area. This study adopts the theoretical lens of New Literacy studies to suggest a combined perspective for investigating social media literacies. This perspective considers both social media skills that are transversal across different social media (global skills), and those that pertain to a specific social media platform (local skills). It examines practices that are decontextualized (literacy as something to be acquired), and those that are situated and context-dependent (literacy through participation). To map current research on social media skills, a systematic literature review was conducted. Analysis of 54 publications was carried out following the UNESCO DLGF framework for digital literacy competencies, and also using a critical lens based on four metaphors whereby, for learning purposes, social media are seen as a tool, as a process, as collaboration, and as participation. The results show that most of the studies consider global social media skills, while only a few examine skills sets specific to a particular social media platform. In addition, most of the identified skills concern decontextualized practices, with very few studies emphasizing the importance of fostering situated social media practices. We conclude that there is a need for more expansive theoretical elaboration in the field, and provide a number of recommendations for investigating, understanding, and designing educational curricula and activities that support the development of social media literacy.}

This integration took place in diverse ways and with a diverse range of motivation. This article articulates this diversity and argues for a careful examination of pre-college curriculum and practices in engineering. In particular, an understanding on the engineering philosophy and practices of the engineering profession must guide curriculum decisions to enable authentic and engaging learning and inclusive education.}
