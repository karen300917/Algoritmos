abstract = {As the media industry moves to a post-industrial model, there is a need for journalists—current and future—to have a deeper understanding of the ways that technology impacts their work and how best to produce journalism for mobile and networked devices. This article examines a teaching initiative designed to introduce journalism students to elements of social and mobile technology theory and design practice. Using feedback gained from peers, students, and industry professionals, the initiative was deemed successful; however, we outline several recommendations for improvement.}

abstract = {Using the test scores of more than 1,000,000 students who participated in the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) exams from 1997 to 2020, this study examined the direction and magnitude of the trends in gender disparity in participation and top achievement in advanced exams. The findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020. Similarly, the MFR among top scorers (students who scored 5 out of 5) in any type of AP CS exams declined rapidly, in favor of female students, from 8.00 to 2.14 during the same period. Possible implications of these findings for educators, particularly for AP CS teachers and school counselors, were also discussed in the context of the underrepresentation of females in computing fields.}

abstract = {There is a currently a shortage of computer science professionals and this shortage is projected to continue into the foreseeable future as not enough students are selecting computer science majors. Researchers and policy-makers agree that development of this career pipeline starts in elementary school. Our study examined which collaborative programming setup, pair programming (two students collaborate on one computer) or side-by-side programming (two students collaborate on the same program from two computers), fifth-grade students preferred. We also sought to understand why students preferred one method over the other and explored ideas on how to effectively design a collaborative programming environment for this age group. Our study had participants first engage in five instructional days, alternating between pair and side-by-side programming, and then conducted focus groups. We found that students overwhelmingly preferred side-by-side programming. We explain this using self-determination theory which states that behavior is motivated by three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and psychological relatedness which side-by-side programming was better able to meet.}

abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) enhances knowledge and decision-making. Despite its importance, the connection between technical progress and political change is neglected in the administrative process. Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy. However, this article aims to explore the potential of BDA for public policy systems and provide a linkage for the transformation toward digital and smart governance using preferred reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to reveal the relevant documents and narrative review approach to interpret the application of BDA at each step of the public policy system. In addition, this study identifies several common public policy-related big data sources and techniques that could be used at the various stages of the public policy process. This study argues that BDA has the potential to be used for policy formulation in the four main phases—planning, design, service delivery, and evaluation. Most studies confirm its potential in the policy process for taxation, health, education, transportation, law, economy, and social system. This study reveals that it is also suitable for public policy execution stages, such as public supervision, public regulation, service delivery, and policy feedback. Previous studies have indicated that the application of BDA can transform traditional or manual governance systems into digital and smart governance. We contend that the policy cycle should be seen as a dynamic and iterative process characterized by continuous evolution. Though each step of transformation has its unique challenges in handling BDA and maintaining the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, it can ensure an accurate, prompt, and context-oriented public policy system. These insights provide a novel outlook on effectively managing the interplay between innovation and traditional approaches in the realm of public policy development.}

New skills, competencies and pedagogies are required by the field to help overcome the data-skills gap. As a means to address these deficiencies, we introduce the Data Science Literacy Framework, a heuristic for incorporating data science principles into public administration programs. The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education.}

Results of multilevel, multivariate regression analyses revealed that, net of the inclusion of control variables for student, teacher, and school characteristics, a higher frequency of inquiry-based instruction is significantly associated with greater interest, perceptions of utility, and self-efficacy for science and mathematics. Furthermore, although there is some evidence indicating that compared with female students, male students’ perceptions of science utility are higher in relation to more inquiry-based instruction, overall, the weight of evidence clearly leans toward the conclusion that the attitudes of students from different gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are similarly associated with greater exposure to inquiry-based instruction in both their science and mathematics classrooms.}

Based on previous research, we provide potential ways to implement the five core instructional components of explicit instruction in today’s inquiry–based science classrooms.}

The protocol analysis method was employed to study the designers’ behavior. In order to explore the development of design patterns in the empirical data, Markov model analysis is utilized. Through Markov models analysis of the parametric design environment and geometric modeling environment results, it was found that there are some significantly different design patterns being used when designing in a parametric design environment compared to designing in a geometric modeling environment. The article articulates these differences and draws conclusions from these results.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emotional management of workers can not only increase the efficiency of work, but also contribute to the improvement of the productivity of a company. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review surveyed the literature to identify the relationship between postural expression and emotion during sedentary tasks. METHODS: We searched relevant literature published up to December 1, 2019 using seven electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, and MEDLINE Complete). RESULTS: A total of 14 publications were included in this scoping review. It was found that the application of pressure sensor and camera-based measurement equipment was effective. Additionally, it was proposed to predict the emotional state of the worker by using forward and backward movements as the main variable as opposed to left and right movements. The information-based analysis technique was able to further increase the accuracy of workers’ emotion prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The emotion prediction of workers based on sitting posture could be confirmed for certain movements, and the information-based technical method could further increase the accuracy of prediction. Expansion of information-based technical research will further increase the possibility of predicting the emotions of workers based on posture, and this will in turn promote safer and more efficient work performance.}

In this study, based on the principle of Bandura’s social learning theory, the vicarious real-life experiences of several pioneers in the field of IT and programming were presented as 15-minutes stories to a group of 9th graders learning to code in Python. A quasi-experimental research design was used to examine the effects of the theory and associated technique on student achievement. The 27 participants in the experiment group watched these presentations before engaging in programming activities while a control group were also observed who received no extra motivational intervention. Those in the experiment group were found to have significantly improved their programming achievement compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the functionality and originality of the experimental group projects were significantly better than those produced in the control group. They reported that they had been motivated by the pioneer stories, and their interest and self-efficacy beliefs in relation to creating high level programming projects were increased. The results highlight the benefits obtained from proper application of a “pioneer-story technique” to improve text-based programming skills.}

The results showed that Gen-AI significantly improved college students’ academic achievement with a medium effect size (Hedges’s g = 0.533, 95% CI [0.408,0.659], p < .05). There were within-group differences in the three moderator variables, activity categories, sample size, and generated content, when the generated content was text (g = 0.554, p < .05), and sample size of 21–40 (g = 0.776, p < .05), the use of independent learning styles (g = 0.600, p < .05) had the most significant improvement in college student’s academic achievement. The intervention duration, the discipline types, and the assessment tools also had a moderate positive impact on college students’ academic achievement, but there were no significant within-group differences in any of the moderating variables. This study provides a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for the scientific application of Gen-AI and the development of educational technology policy.}

Through Markov models analysis of the parametric design environment and geometric modeling environment results, it was found that there are some significantly different design patterns being used when designing in a parametric design environment compared to designing in a geometric modeling environment. The article articulates these differences and draws conclusions from these results.}

abstract = {Background: Women and people of color are consistently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and careers. Though there are myriad factors underlying these gaps, one potential variable may be the extent to which these students feel connected to their STEM classroom experiences. Purpose: The present study investigated the potential of a service-learning experience to support STEM engagement for underrepresented youth. Methodology/Approach: Two cohorts of high school students participated in a summer program through which they built “solar suitcases” to provide electricity for communities in need. Observations and student surveys measured student engagement and changes in STEM attitudes, dispositions, and beliefs. Findings/Conclusions: Students were highly engaged in service-learning activities and demonstrated improved Science Fascination, Science Values, and STEM Career Affinity after participating in the program. Implications: Implications for the design and delivery of culturally relevant service-learning experiences are discussed.}

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in generalized control perception for 43 undergraduate adults may be reflected in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates during conversation in an interview. Control perception was assessed by means of Rotter’s internal-external Locus of Control questionnaires, while Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates were computed from filmed videos of interviews consisting of a series of questions which could presumably have triggered different mental states. Pearson correlations and linear regression analyses indicated that the individual differences in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates did not differ significantly across different questions, but that Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates measured over the entire interview correlated positively and significantly with an internal Locus of Control (r = .26). This could be interpreted as modest but corroborative evidence that a personality trait reflecting control perception may have a biological component. The possible roles of dopamine neurotransmission and frontal cortex involvement in higher cognition and Locus of Control are discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose A pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a curriculum that overtly teaches computer programming while covertly scaffolding social-communication skills for autistic children aged 8–12 years. Methods Participants were taught the Python programming language so they could program their own chatbots to greet a human user and discuss different topics, taking turns during the discussion, as though the chatbot were a human itself. The students were challenged with creating chatbots that pass the ‘Turing Test’, where a human evaluator would not be able to tell whether their chatbots were humans or computer programs. The curriculum included didactic instruction, peer-group discussion, homework and the chatbot project. Six autistic children participated in the six-session program. Feasibility was assessed using questionnaires and qualitative feedback. Results The curriculum is deemed feasible and desirable. There was no measurable change in social-communication skills immediately following the six-session program. Participants and their parents were highly interested in similar programs in the future, suggesting promising potential for further development and refinement. Conclusion A curriculum of programming a chatbot that also covertly scaffolds social communication is feasible for autistic children who are interested in computer programming.}

abstract = {This paper presents a computational economics model of the property-liability insurance underwriting cycle. This computer experiment is built on downward-sloping demand, a simplistic version of the capacity constraint model of insurance supply, and a simple pricing rule. The pricing rule has each experimental insurer determine its price from the expected losses per-policy (a constant), the previous year’s policyholders’ surplus and the previous year’s number of customers. Through the use of directional bit sequences a common structure is revealed between the simulated aggregate underwriting margin and the actual aggregate underwriting margin, 1930–2000. The common structure between these aggregate variables is evidence the property-liability underwriting cycle, in a consistent effort to reach equilibrium, follows an algorithmic process. Of more general inference; the pursuit of equilibrium, as an attractor, is the only consistent characteristic of the algorithmically generated process. This algorithmic process precludes the notion of a consistent continuous probability distribution being the basis of a data generating process (DGP). The times series behavior of the simulated underwriting margin, as it fluctuates around the equilibrium attractor, can assume a variety of shapes across many realizations of the algorithmic process. Finally, behavior of the simulated individual companies is not, for the most part, correlated with the aggregate behavior, and virtually all individual transactions are out-of-equilibrium transactions in the sense that they occur along the demand curve.}

This has generated a varied set of digital skills and a new type of architectural knowledge. However, up to now, a theoretical framework is missing that would allow for a comprehensive pedagogical agenda for the teaching of digital design in architecture. The present paper offers an attempt towards such a theoretical grounding based on the concept of computable functions. This approach results in an abstract and formal perspective on digital design that enables a grouping of contemporary digital design methods and an understanding of their logical relationship. On a theoretical level, it opens a path for the study of the mechanism that facilitates the transfer of concepts from various scientific disciplines into architecture.}

The study aims to identify the types of technological tools used to enhance students’ creativity and examine how technological tools can support students’ creativity in K-12 music education. This review selected and analyzed 17 studies published from 1987 to 2022 in peer-reviewed journals using a rigorous five-stage scoping framework. Data extraction and analysis were conducted in Covidence. The results revealed eight types of technological tools used to enhance creativity in the music classroom, in which sequencer software and GarageBand were the most commonly used type of technological tools and applications respectively. Technology’s support for creativity was also discussed from the perspectives of Lubart’s four roles of computers: (a) computer as nanny, (b) computer as pen-pal, (c) computer as coach, and (d) computer as colleague. The results showed a dearth of research on how technology can become students’ partners to help them generate creative ideas. Based on the findings, this review concluded with implications and recommendations for future research.}

abstract = {In contrast to traditional models of design process fundamentally defined by the abstract manipulation of objects, this study recognizes that the resources available for rethinking architecture are to be found in a reformulation of its theory and practice. This reformation should be based on non-linear design processes in which dynamic emergence and invention take the place of a linear design process fixed on a particular object evolution. Advances in computation thinking and technology have stimulated the design and formulation of a large number of design software. Its elaboration supposes a new conceptualization of our discipline’s knowledge, in a body of principles and regulations, which commands the artifact’s design and its realization; therefore, it constitutes a preliminary datum for its comprehension, and thereby is of theoretical importance. Despite the continuous increment of power in computers and software capacities, the creative space of freedom defined by them acting as cognitive instruments remains almost unexplored. Therefore, we propose a change from a design knowledge based on objects to one focused on design as a network of processes. In addition, this study explores the concept of Distributed Cognition in order to redefine the use of digital tools in design process as Cognitive Instruments.}

abstract = {This study sheds light on a holistic understanding of muqarnas with its historical, philosophical and conceptual backgrounds on one hand and formal, structural and algorithmic principles on the other hand. The vault-like Islamic architectural element, muqarnas, is generally considered to be a non-structural decorative element. Various compositional approaches have been proposed to reveal the inner logic of these complex geometric elements. Each of these approaches uses different techniques such as measuring, unit-based decoding or three-dimensional interpretation of two-dimensional patterns. However, the reflections of the inner logic onto different contexts, such as the usage of different initial geometries, materials or performative concerns, were neglected. In this study, we offer a new schema to approach the performative aspects of muqarnas tectonics. This schema contains new sets of elements, properties and relations deriving partly from previous approaches and partly from the technique of folding. Thus, this study first reviews the previous approaches to analyse the geometric and constructional principles of muqarnas. Second, it explains the proposed scheme through a series of algorithmic form-finding experiments. In these experiments, we question whether ‘fold’, as one of the performative techniques of making three-dimensional forms, contributes to the analysis of muqarnas in both a conceptual and computational sense. We argue that encoding vault-like systems via geometric and algorithmic relations based on the logic of the ‘fold’ provides informative and intuitive feedback for form-finding, specifically in the earlier phases of design. While focusing on the performative potential of a specific fold operation, we introduced the concept of bifurcation to describe the generative characteristics of folding technique and the way of subdividing the form with respect to redistribution of the forces. Thus, in this decoding process, the bifurcated fold explains not only to demystify the formal logic of muqarnas but also to generate new forms without losing contextual conditions.}

They are grounded by interdisciplinarity, borrowing to digital humanities, cultural studies, or new media studies. Their application domains are as heterogeneous as software can be, from interfaces to new digital mediatic forms. This paper examines the relevance of software studies for journalism studies in the context of automated news production, where technological artifacts can also be understood as being shaped by professional values and cultural practices. It also explores methods nourished by software studies’ theories to tackle news automation through a process-oriented approach. The cursor is placed on the materiality of the upstream components of automated news production: the data that feed the systems and the process that will make the news. Automated news production appears as a remixed editorial process nourished by previous editorial experiences that will be standardized through a some-how imitation game where technological and human mediation interplay. This paper addresses the issue of transparency with the flattening of the processes at work, relying on theories and methodological tools based on software studies.}

abstract = {In the fourth industrial revolution, programming promises to be a fundamental subject like mathematics, science, languages ​​or the arts. Architects design more than buildings developing innovative methods and they are among the pioneers in visual programming development. However, after more than 10 years of visual programming in architecture, despite the fast-learning curve, visual programming presents considerable limitations to solve complex problems. To overcome limitations, the authors propose to associate the advantages of visual and textual languages in Python. The article addresses an ongoing research study to implement Computational Methods in Architectural Education. The authors began by describing the general goal of this project, and of this article in particular. This article focuses on the implementation of two disciplines ‘Computation for Architecture in Python’ I and II. The first discipline uses programming based on the construction of functions in the imperative language, implemented in the text editor, in visual programming, using Grasshopper methods. The second discipline, which is under development, intends to teach object-oriented programming. The results of the first discipline are encouraging; despite reported difficulties in programming fundamentals, such as lists, loops and recursion. The development of the second discipline, in object-oriented programming, deals with the concepts of classes and objects, and more abstract principles such abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism or encapsulation. This paradigm allows building robust programs, but requires a more in-depth syntax. The article reports this ongoing research on this new paradigm of object-oriented language, expanding the application of a hybrid visual-textual language in Architecture.}

From this perspective, the present study tries to understand data journalism practices in India and suggests certain insights to integrate data journalism training in programmes offered by Indian journalism education. By probing insights from the literature on data journalism education and by examining existing data journalism practices in India, the study calls for intervention with a pedagogic strategy to impart better data-sourcing practices, coding skills and critical data literacy among the students as an antidote to the prevalent DIY culture and overdependence on data aggregates. The pedagogic strategy should convey the importance of audience centrality and ethics in data journalism practice.

The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K–12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.}

abstract = {Through the recent technological developments within the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) studies have had a huge impact on various disciplines such as social sciences, information communication technologies (ICTs), architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Regarding decision-making and forecasting systems in particular, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies have provided an opportunity to improve the mutual relationships between machines and humans. When the connection between ML and architecture is considered, it is possible to claim that there is no parallel acceleration as in other disciplines. In this study, and considering the latest breakthroughs, we focus on revealing what ML and architecture have in common. Our focal point is to reveal common points by classifying and analyzing current literature through describing the potential of ML in architecture. Studies conducted using ML techniques and subsets of AI technologies were used in this paper, and the resulting data were interpreted using the bibliometric analysis method. In order to discuss the state-of-the-art research articles which have been published between 2014 and 2020, main subjects, subsets, and keywords were refined through the search engines. The statistical figures were demonstrated as huge datasets, and the results were clearly delineated through Sankey diagrams. Thanks to bibliometric analyses of the current literature of WOS (Web of Science), CUMINCAD (Cumulative Index about publications in Computer Aided Architectural Design supported by the sibling associations ACADIA, CAADRIA, eCAADe, SIGraDi, ASCAAD, and CAAD futures), predictable data have been presented allowing recommendations for possible future studies for researchers.}

abstract = {Although literacy research has traditionally focused on content area and disciplinary literacies, in this study we argue for the importance of transdisciplinarity. We employed a participatory action research design to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) planning of a transdisciplinary math and music lesson to understand how conceptual framing of pedagogy and instructional practice can be shifted from content literacies to transdisciplinarity. Our area of inquiry focused on how PSTs’ understanding of transdisciplinarity shifted as they planned, taught, and reflected on instruction and how these shifts were supported by others. We documented evidence of how the lesson progressed from disciplinary thinking to interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary thinking throughout the planning process. We also documented how the process of planning, teaching, coaching, and reflecting provided PSTs with an opportunity to better understand the connections between transdisciplinarity and pedagogy.}

A total of 422 Singaporean full-time physical education teachers (mean age = 38.47 years, standard deviation = 8.31) completed the Physical Education Teachers’ Subjective Theories Questionnaire to assess their perspectives towards the integration of information and communication technologies into physical education teaching practice. Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests were conducted to examine the differences in participants’ attitudes across different demographic groups. Results revealed that attitudes towards information and communication technologies significantly differed between teachers of different gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no significant difference was found in attitudes towards information and communication technologies among teachers of different school levels. The findings of this study can inform policy-makers and stakeholders with an interest in promoting the integration of information and communication technologies in physical education.}

abstract = {The aim of this article was to analyse the employability of currently enrolled secondary education (classes 9–12) students aged 14–21, specifically their functional digital skills. Digital skills are increasingly being recognised as a key foundational skill that also enhances employability. Gaining digital skills at the secondary education is important because it is one of the foundational skills that help prepare students transition to work and prepares them for life. There were three major objectives in this article: (a) to examine the trends and transitions in the acquisition of functional digital skills of currently enrolled secondary school Indian students according to their socio-economic and demographic profiles; (b) empirically investigate the factors influencing the acquisition of functional digital skills in urban areas and (c) examine whether the policy of providing schools with computers has had any discernible impact on the acquisition of functional digital skills of these students. Using the National Statistical Office 2017–2018 data on expenditure on education, we found that at the national level only 42% of the enrolled secondary school students had the ability to operate a computer and 46% had the ability to browse Internet in 2017–2018. The attainment of functional digital skills differed across rural and urban regions. The individual characteristics, socio-economic profile of households and school-related indicators were factors that explained the likelihood of students’ being equipped with functional digital skills. A key result was that students who had digital devices at home were more likely to have functional digital skills. The government had introduced computers in secondary schools in 2004 in India. We found evidence of a positive association between the provision of functional computers at secondary schools and attainment of digital skills, even for students from households with no computers at home. A key policy recommendation is that providing computers at schools can help overcome barriers to access to digital devices at home and improve the attainment of digital skills.

abstract = {Emerging technological advancements can play an essential role in overcoming challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a promising educational technology field, Learning Analytics (LA) tools or systems can offer solutions to COVID-19 pandemic-related needs, obstacles, and expectations in higher education. In the current study, we systematically reviewed 20 papers to better understand the responses of LA tools to the online learning challenges that higher education students, instructors, and institutions faced during the pandemic. In addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular, individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them. Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning process, fostering learners’ engagement and motivation, facilitating assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into future higher education policies.}

abstract = {Since programming processes involve different thinking skills and different fields of knowledge, it is especially important for children to acquire 21st-century skills. Even though the programming education activities are being intensively applied, it can be said that there is a gap in quantitative researches supporting the effort to reveal the direct or indirect effectiveness of the learning–teaching processes for the programming education. This study, which was done to fill this gap, aims to examine the degree to which students learn programming concepts (PC) and to identify effective variables in that process with a developed curriculum for gifted students studying in the second–third–fourth grade in primary schools. For this purpose, a 15-week application was carried out and each student developed an individual project. In the study, a criterion list, observation forms and peer evaluations were used based on PC to examine projects and learning process. The scores obtained from these tools were used to examine the application of each participant, to comment on the effective variables and the adequacy of the teaching process. The evidence from this study intimates that female participants obtained higher scores than male ones in programming education. Those scores are higher in 9 and 10 age group of students than others. Those who haven’t had Internet access, who have never used computer or have had access to Internet as well as who haven’t had any computer courses had lower scores than others. The upshot of this is that previous computer technology experiences of students may have affected the scores obtained programming education process.}

The text introduces fashion film as a genre and as an historically dynamic form of audiovisual expression that we approach through fashion history, media archaeology and new film history. While introducing key concepts and approaches, the authors propose a form of ‘parallax historiography’, a term emerging from Thomas Elsaesser’s work, that links different time periods from early cinema to recent digital platforms, even ‘post-cinema’. The introduction makes references to the contributions in this issue that address historical conditions of emergence, marginal voices in the historical record and unexcavated archival materials; and the issue shows how they all contain feedback loops or recursive traits that resonate in contemporary practice where infrastructures of platforms and data frame the moving image.}

This analysis helps us understand the extent to which recent research is disrupting, or sustaining, minoritizing narratives about multilingual students and how they sensemake in science. Based on our findings, we suggest researchers: (1) reflect upon and expand their views of language, which will enable the field to develop more nuanced understandings of how language use across linguistic and multimodal resources permeates all science practices, and (2) consider how to expand multilingual students’ language repertoires for sensemaking while also valuing students’ existing language resources and practices.}

Many students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) have difficulties with skills that address attention, and teachers are expected to provide support. Such skills are referred to as Executive Function (EF) in neuroscience, relating to self-regulation, attention shifting, and inhibition of behavior. This systematic literature review outlines research on primary education during 2000–2022 that relates students’ EF and digital technology through empirical data and suggested SEN-inclusive educational interventions. 288 full-text journal articles were assessed, and 26 were included for analysis. Findings include common game-based solutions for EF and SEN support, enabling explicit goals, short teaching activities, and recorded outcomes. Other examples include EF skills training and classroom management with digital monitoring devices. A substantially increased research interest during 2021–2022 was observed. Aspects needing further research are discussed, such as more special education views with cost-effective behavioral approaches.}

abstract = {Credit default has always been one of the critical factors in the development of personal credit business. By establishing a default identification model, default can be avoided effectively. There are some existing methods to identify credit default. However, these methods have some problems: Problem (1): It is different to deal the non-linear data, Problem (2): The local stagnation results in the high error rate, and Problem (3): The premature convergence leads to the low classification rate. In this paper, the sinhTSA-MLP default risk identification model is proposed to solve these problems. In this model, the proposed sinhTSA method can effectively avoid the problems of falling into local optimum and premature convergence. And the benchmark test results demonstrate sinhTSA is superior to other methods. According to the two experiments, the classification rate reaches 77.35% and 96.48%. Therefore, the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has some particular advantages in identifying credit problems The feasibility of the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has been proved through helping to manage credit default more consciously.}

abstract = {Things we can do because of learning are called outcomes of learning. Outcome based education (OBE) was propounded by William Spady in the 90s to bring the focus of formal education to what the students learn rather than what they were taught. OBE is a system of education giving priority to ends, purpose, accomplishments, and results. All decisions about the curriculum, assessment, and instruction are driven by the exit learning outcomes the students should display at the end of a program or a course. This paper presents a method of writing outcomes for General higher education programs. Outcomes for a higher education program are defined at three levels as program outcomes (POs), program specific outcomes (PSOs), and course outcomes (COs). The most important aspect of an outcome is that it should be observable and measurable. These are best written in a well-defined framework of taxonomy of learning. Bloom’s taxonomy of learning identifies three domains of learning: Cognitive, affective and psychomotor. Revised Bloom taxonomy of cognitive domain has two dimensions cognitive levels and knowledge categories. It is proposed that CO statements be written within a well-defined structure: Action, knowledge elements, conditions, and criteria. Tagging COs with POs, PSOs, cognitive levels and the number of classroom hours associated facilitates the computation of attainment of COs, POs, and PSOs.}

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.}

This study employed a mixed-method approach which aims to identify the emerging factors which inform about Malaysian audiences’ perception of cinema-going in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines the audiences with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as this theory claims that people are more likely to act in a certain way if they feel certain behaviors will lead to specific results that are in keeping with their values. This study identified the attitude toward cinema reopening and readiness toward visiting cinema are able to significantly predict all the related factors of cinemagoers’ willingness in the post COVID-19 era. The results informed on the concerns of their family members, friends, and those with whom they have regular physical contact have become the agent of decision-making in terms of cinema-going.}

abstract = {Mass adoption of advanced information technologies is fueling a need for public servants with the skills to manage data-driven public agencies. Public employees typically acquire data skills through graduate research methods courses, which focus primarily on research design and statistical analysis. What data skills are currently taught, and what content should Master of Public Administration (MPA) programs include in their research method courses? We categorized research method course content in 52 syllabi from 31 MPA programs to understand how data skills are taught in public administration. We find that most graduate programs rely on research methods more suited for academic and policy research while lacking the data skills needed to modernize public agencies. Informed by these results, this work presents the Data Science Literacy Framework as a guide for assessing and planning curriculum within MPA programs.}

As newsrooms began a decades-long shift toward digitalization and data-driven, social-scientific reporting, industry thought leaders used educational texts to introduce and enculturate rank-and-file journalists into increasingly technologized practices. Analysis of 15 textbooks from before the launch of the commercial Internet through the “digital turn” of the late 2000s finds many texts focused on persuading reluctant newsworkers to get on board with CAR — suggesting a pollyannaish technological determinism regarding the potential of computer technology to save newspapers and transform society.}

This article offers a comparative case study of classroom videos using a dynamic visual method to map embodied interaction called “interaction geography.” Our analysis proposes an integrative framework to study classroom interactions and teacher movement over space and time comprised of four salient characteristics within lessons: trails, landmarks, material routines, and circulation patterns. We discuss how this visual method and framework can be used and expanded by classroom researchers and teachers as a starting point to better understand teaching as a situative and spatial practice, a crucial step in characterizing responsive forms of instruction. This work has implications not only for teachers and teacher educators but also for architects, administrators, and researchers concerned with the physical design of classrooms.}

abstract = {Recognizing individual needs and customer preferences is key to succeeding and increasing competitiveness in both the commercial and public sectors. In the public sector, this is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of public funds allocated to public libraries. However, in order to make the right decisions, library management needs quality information about preferences and consumer behaviour, even from customers who cannot be the subject of routine research due to their young age. Therefore, this article proposes a new methodology for surveying children in order to design library services. The proposed methodology, which integrates principles from ethnographic and sociological methods, aims to overcome the problems of conventional sociological methods, such as how to conceive a child as a respondent and how to determine their preferences from hypothetical situations. This article uses a specially designed questionnaire tool to identify preferences, behaviour and information from children (as visitors of a library). The authors learned that Czech children went to the library primarily for books and games. In addition, the data from the questionnaire revealed patterns in the children’s and adults’ behaviour when visiting the library. All of the data in this article can be used for further research into consumer behaviour.}

abstract = {The ball mill is usually the largest energy consumer at a mine site and significantly affects operational expenditures. Given a target particle size, Bond Mill Work Index estimates are used to predict a ball mill’s throughput. In order to maximize ball mill throughput and optimize energy utilization, it is important to get these estimates right. At the Tropicana Gold Mine, Work Index estimates, derived from X-Ray Fluorescence and Hyperspectral scanning of Grade Control samples, are used to construct spatial GeoMetallurgical models (GeoMet). Inaccuracies in block estimates exist due to limited calibration between grade control derived and laboratory Work Index values. To improve the calibration, an updating algorithm has been tested at the Tropicana Gold Mine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate a new process for updating block estimates using actual mill performance data. Deviations between predicted and actual mill performance are monitored and used to locally improve the Work Index estimates in the GeoMet model. The updating algorithm improves the spatial Work Index estimates, resulting in a real-time reconciliation of already extracted blocks and a recalibration of future scheduled blocks. The case study shows that historic and future production estimates improve on average by about 72 and 26%.}

abstract = {This paper describes a module for the teaching of diffusion to mechanical engineering students that can be part of a course on numerical methods or advanced engineering mathematics and as a precursor to a heat transfer course. The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics – an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods.}

It also examines whether there is a significant relationship between students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills and their major. The participants of the study were 75 female students enrolled in an Educational Technology and Means course at Najran University. The findings revealed that there is a significant and positive relationship between implementing a project-based collaborative learning approach using PowerPoint and improving the students’ 21st-century skills, r (74) = 0.74 and p < 0.05. Additionally, the findings demonstrated that 21st-century skills improved the most through “actively collaborating with others” (M = 4.6, SD = 0.56). Additionally, there was no significant difference in students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills in terms of human studies or scientific studies majors, t (37) = 1.97 and p > 0.05. The findings demonstrate that more research is required on the role of higher education in developing meaningful technology-based strategies to improve students’ 21st-century skills in learning environments.}

abstract = {The critical research agenda on smart cities has tended to assume a largely top-down orientation in which powerful actors like the state and corporations enact programmes to embed Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) in the urban landscape. Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below’. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness’ is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued. These actors strategically move between different interstices in order to enact particular kinds of political influence, and often influence smart cities by virtue of their absence, profoundly impacting urban political geographies of smartness.}

This study employed a mixed-method approach which aims to identify the emerging factors which inform about Malaysian audiences’ perception of cinema-going in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines the audiences with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as this theory claims that people are more likely to act in a certain way if they feel certain behaviors will lead to specific results that are in keeping with their values. This study identified the attitude toward cinema reopening and readiness toward visiting cinema are able to significantly predict all the related factors of cinemagoers’ willingness in the post COVID-19 era. The results informed on the concerns of their family members, friends, and those with whom they have regular physical contact have become the agent of decision-making in terms of cinema-going.}

While much scholarship supports gamification, labor sociologists have long problematized the phenomenon. In this mixed-methods action research study, we explore the results of gamifying a lesson on gamification in a sociology of work course. We designed two gamified activities with varying degrees of consent that followed a lesson on gamification and consent. Students rated how problematic a series of gamified work scenarios were before and after the intervention. Our quantitative data did not show a significant increase in students’ ability to identify consent after the intervention, but we did discover that students took either an employee or employer’s perspective in their rating justifications. Furthermore, these findings were gendered. This article highlights the need for a more critical take on gamification in the classroom. We conclude by suggesting ways practitioners can teach about gamification in other contexts.}

We introduce the concepts of computer world and ministories which draw parallels between the online and offline worlds. While creating the concepts of computer world and ministories, we follow Richard Mayer’s theory of multimedia learning, and thus ministories are based on the appropriate combination of images and texts. The study attempts to answer the following general question: ‘Is it better to teach people how to work with specific apps for everyday use or teach them the principles that are behind them?’. This question should be asked when creating new approach in IT education and not only in lifelong learning.}

To enhance the quality of computer science teachers, clear and consistent preparation and certification pathways are needed for teachers to implement computer science education. This study extends on prior work by creating a consistent framework of definitions for talking about and comparing CS teacher qualification pathways policies across states. We summarized the current landscape of the CS teacher pathways for all 50 states as of 2020. Nineteen states had an initial certification program, 42 states had an add-on license, and 24 states had an authorization pathway. There were five states that did not have any computer science teacher qualification pathways policy: Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Oregon. We discuss the policy implications and recommendations for future research around CS teacher qualification pathways.}

Fast-paced automation, the importance of cosmopolitanism and the colonial legacy have come to dominate educational discourse and drive calls for streamlined educative practice. Although such efficiency models empower a transactional/linear mode of teaching and learning, they do little to privilege integrative voices, deliberation and intersubjective care found in global citizenship education (GCE) definitions. We argue such rationality has exacerbated a neo-colonial ethic that promulgates economic, political and cultural pressure to control and narrow otherwise diverse learning opportunities. Drawing from recent research into technology and GCE in two International Baccalaureate international schools, we note the importance of communicative outreach and agency in diversity. We also highlight the distorting effects of hyper-rationalised neo-colonial interpretations of global agency. This article will interest those seeking to develop global educational policy and practice along with revitalising interpretations of technology integration.}

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.}

We trace the development of the Share the Facts “widget,” a device designed to give fact-checks greater purchase in algorithmically governed media networks by driving adoption of a new data standard called ClaimReview. We show how “structured journalism” gave journalists a language for the social and technical challenges involved, and how this infrastructural technology mediates between fact-checkers, audiences, and platform companies. We argue that this standard-setting initiative exhibits both promotional and disciplining facets, offering greater distribution and impact to journalists while also defining their work in specific ways. Crucially, in this case, this disciplining influence reflects internal professional-institutional agendas in an emerging subfield of journalism as much as the demands of platform companies.}

Public employees typically acquire data skills through graduate research methods courses, which focus primarily on research design and statistical analysis. What data skills are currently taught, and what content should Master of Public Administration (MPA) programs include in their research method courses? We categorized research method course content in 52 syllabi from 31 MPA programs to understand how data skills are taught in public administration. We find that most graduate programs rely on research methods more suited for academic and policy research while lacking the data skills needed to modernize public agencies. Informed by these results, this work presents the Data Science Literacy Framework as a guide for assessing and planning curriculum within MPA programs.}

Analysis of 15 textbooks from before the launch of the commercial Internet through the “digital turn” of the late 2000s finds many texts focused on persuading reluctant newsworkers to get on board with CAR — suggesting a pollyannaish technological determinism regarding the potential of computer technology to save newspapers and transform society.}

We discuss how this visual method and framework can be used and expanded by classroom researchers and teachers as a starting point to better understand teaching as a situative and spatial practice, a crucial step in characterizing responsive forms of instruction. This work has implications not only for teachers and teacher educators but also for architects, administrators, and researchers concerned with the physical design of classrooms.}

abstract = {Recognizing individual needs and customer preferences is key to succeeding and increasing competitiveness in both the commercial and public sectors. In the public sector, this is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of public funds allocated to public libraries. However, in order to make the right decisions, library management needs quality information about preferences and consumer behaviour, even from customers who cannot be the subject of routine research due to their young age. Therefore, this article proposes a new methodology for surveying children in order to design library services. The proposed methodology, which integrates principles from ethnographic and sociological methods, aims to overcome the problems of conventional sociological methods, such as how to conceive a child as a respondent and how to determine their preferences from hypothetical situations. This article uses a specially designed questionnaire tool to identify preferences, behaviour and information from children (as visitors of a library). The authors learned that Czech children went to the library primarily for books and games. In addition, the data from the questionnaire revealed patterns in the children’s and adults’ behaviour when visiting the library. All of the data in this article can be used for further research into consumer behaviour.}

abstract = {This study developed a fuzzy logic and Gagné learning hierarchy (FL-GLH) for assessing mathematics skills and identifying learning barrier points. Fuzzy logic was used to model the human reasoning process in linguistic terms. Specifically, fuzzy logic was used to build relationships between skill level concepts as inputs and learning achievement as an output. Gagné learning hierarchy was used to develop a learning hierarchy diagram, which included learning paths and test questions for assessing mathematics skills. First, the Gagné learning hierarchy was used to generate learning path diagrams and test questions. In the second step, skill level concepts were grouped, and their membership functions were established to fuzzify the input parameters and to build membership functions of learning achievement as an output. Third, the inference engine generated fuzzy values by applying fuzzy rules based on fuzzy reasoning. Finally, the defuzzifier converted fuzzy values to crisp output values for learning achievement. Practical applications of the FL-GLH confirmed its effectiveness for evaluating student learning achievement, for finding student learning barrier points, and for providing teachers with guidelines for improving learning efficiency in students.}

abstract = {The ball mill is usually the largest energy consumer at a mine site and significantly affects operational expenditures. Given a target particle size, Bond Mill Work Index estimates are used to predict a ball mill’s throughput. In order to maximize ball mill throughput and optimize energy utilization, it is important to get these estimates right. At the Tropicana Gold Mine, Work Index estimates, derived from X-Ray Fluorescence and Hyperspectral scanning of Grade Control samples, are used to construct spatial GeoMetallurgical models (GeoMet). Inaccuracies in block estimates exist due to limited calibration between grade control derived and laboratory Work Index values. To improve the calibration, an updating algorithm has been tested at the Tropicana Gold Mine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate a new process for updating block estimates using actual mill performance data. Deviations between predicted and actual mill performance are monitored and used to locally improve the Work Index estimates in the GeoMet model. The updating algorithm improves the spatial Work Index estimates, resulting in a real-time reconciliation of already extracted blocks and a recalibration of future scheduled blocks. The case study shows that historic and future production estimates improve on average by about 72 and 26%.}

The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics – an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods.}

As a result, three main steps (focus, fight and finalize) were extracted from students’ behavioral patterns. The results suggest that three steps occur in linear or cyclic manner with regard to the programming constructs required for the solution of the problem. Implications for instructors who desire to provide a better learning experience on problem solving through block-based programming are also included.}

In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage.}

However, the proposed approach provides and enhances ADE through three main concepts: (a) generating design alternatives for different cases of furnishing spaces, (b) providing accurate and flexible evaluations to students’/designers’ works with different levels, and (c) tracking students based on their defaults and relevant sensitive modifications. Different applications of the proposed approach have been generated, analyzed, and validated.}

In this paper, we argue that a solutionist order of worth – in which value derives from solving social problems through technology – has become central to an emerging spirit of digital capitalism. We use supervised learning to trace the relative importance of different orders of worth in three novel text corpora. We find that solutionism is indeed central to the normative beliefs of digital elites and the broader digital milieu, but not to capitalist discourse at large. We illustrate the importance of these findings by discussing how the spirit of digital capitalism motivates, legitimates, and orients the actions of digital capitalists.}

Through this analysis, this article aims at understanding some of the tensions between legacy and digital culture that many newsrooms today are marked by and how these tensions affect professional knowledge creations for the journalists of tomorrow. The study is framed by sociomaterial perspectives on learning and journalistic practice and argues that two types of materiality are especially important for j-students’ professional knowledge creation during periods of internship: the structure and layout of the newsroom and the software applications in use at the newsroom.}

Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.}

abstract = {The emergence of block-based environments aims to facilitate the problems caused by the abstractness of text-based languages. Recent studies generally focus on the effect of having block-based experience on programming education. This study is an attempt to observe the transfer of previous programming experiences (block-based vs. text-based) into a three-dimensional game-making environment through the use of backwards fading. In addition to observation of transfer, students’ perceptions about the difficulty of practices were also investigated. Twenty-one senior university students participated in the study. They practiced through worked example, completion example, and full practice. Moreover, the comparison of the contribution of three examples, their perceived difficulty, and cognitive load has also been observed. There are four main findings that add value to the current literature. First, students having text-based programming experience had higher scores, which may be a sign of far transfer; second, completion example format was more efficient for students having block-based programming experience; third, full practice format was perceived as more difficult than either worked example or completion example; and fourth, based on the efficiency of example formats, completion example represented high efficiency for all students. However, average efficiency of all example formats has represented high efficiency for students, who had text-based programming experience.}

abstract = {In this conceptual article, the relations between sensemaking, learning, and big data in organizations are explored. The availability and usage of big data by organizations is an issue of emerging importance, raising new and old themes for diverse commentators and researchers to investigate. Drawing on sensemaking, learning, and complexity perspectives, this article highlights four key challenges to be addressed if organizations are to engage the phenomenon of big data effectively and reflexively: responding to the dynamic complexity of big data in terms of “simplexity,” analyzing big data using interdisciplinary processes, responsible reflection on ideologies of learning and knowledge production when handling big data, and mutually aligning sensemaking with big data topics to map domains of application. This article concludes with additional implications arising from considering sensemaking in conjunction with big data analytics as a critical way of understanding unique aspects of learning and technology in the 21st century.}

abstract = {There is a growing interest in data amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This article looks at ways in which SMEs can combine their internal company data with open data, such as official statistics, and thereby enhance their business opportunities. Case studies are given as illustrations of the statistical and data-mining methods involved in such integrated data analytics. The article considers the barriers that prevent more SMEs from benefitting in this field and appraises some of the initiatives that are aimed at helping to overcome them. The discussion emphasizes the importance of bringing people together from the business, IT, and statistical worlds and suggests ways for statisticians to make a greater impact.}

abstract = {Our goal in this article is to reflect on the role LEGO robotics has played in college engineering education over the last 15 years, starting with the introduction of the RCX in 1998 and ending with the introduction of the EV3 in 2013. By combining a modular computer programming language with a modular building platform, LEGO Education has allowed students (of all ages) to become active leaders in their own education as they build everything from animals for a robotic zoo to robots that play children’s games. Most importantly, it allows all students to develop different solutions to the same problem to provide a learning community. We look first at how the recent developments in the learning sciences can help in promoting student learning in robotics. We then share four case studies of successful college-level implementations that build on these developments.}

abstract = {Personalisation of media content is not a new phenomenon. Now, however, by configuring our search results and data feeds, algorithms that ‘learn’ from our digital footprint are determining what we see and hear. Pariser calls this the ‘Filter Bubble Effect’. Yet, despite concerns that this effect is a threat to deliberative democracy, we are told there is relatively little evidence to substantiate its existence. This article draws on a case study to argue that this is because the existing research looks for technical effects while neglecting our social lives. If we follow Foucault’s reasoning that systems of thought are also technologies, then we can see that material technologies (or what Foucault called ‘technologies of production’) and immaterial technologies (ideas formed in discourse) can co-constitute filter bubbles. Borrowing language from computing and science and technology studies, this leads to a redefinition of filter bubbles as socio-technical recursion. This case study illustrates just one potential combination of such material and immaterial technologies (namely, search engines and ideas that are encountered and formed during an individual’s social life within their culture and class) that can create socio-technical recursion. The article concludes by arguing the advantage of conceptualising filter bubbles in this way is that it offers us a theoretical foundation for breaking out of this recursion by simultaneously challenging the mediums and messages that sustain them.}

This study therefore conceptualizes equity specifically related to using digital tools with multilingual learners. Drawing on a technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework informed by prior research on (language) teacher education and computer-assisted language learning, this study examines how preservice teachers described their knowledge base specifically related to using digital tools equitably with multilingual learners. Qualitative analysis of 17 preservice teachers’ course discussions, assignments, and interviews revealed that preservice teachers purposefully reflected on and selected digital tools to use that would support students’ language development and leverage students’ interests. They also reflected on structural inequities and advocacy related to technological implementation. This study encourages teacher educators to support preservice teachers in developing technologically savvy practices that are also linguistically responsive and humanizing by centering equity in TPACK.}

abstract = {In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science & technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.}

abstract = {Scientific knowledge, ideally neutral and impartial, is inevitably shaped by geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. This research contends that overcoming the constraints of human and economic scarcity, inertia, and limited funding access demands development of collaborative research networks. To this end, four university laboratories from Brazil and Chile - UFRJ, UBB, UTFSM and UAI - have united to advance robotics applied to architecture. The methodology begins with an analysis of Industry 4.0, Fab Lab implementations, and robotics in architecture in the region. They identify key research aspects by mapping each laboratory’s activities and technologies to pinpoint expertise and potential collaborative areas. The authors propose a summary table comparing the labs and a chronological overview to track regional robotics advancement. To raise awareness among peers, the initiative involves joint actions such as courses, workshops and technical visits.1 Recognising the scarcity of robotic units and the inapplicability of procedures from wealthier contexts, the authors draw on their lab experience to propose guidelines for implementing robotics research units in academia within the region. This includes technological alternatives, installation considerations, and detailed configuration reviews. The deployment of additional robotic units is a means to foster collaboration and bolster the network. Anticipated outcomes encompass increased critical mass, collaborative research initiatives, faculty and student exchange across institutions, higher publication rates, knowledge acquisition, and improved access to global funding agencies. In summary, the Southern Creative Robotics network initiative aims to catalyse the creative integration of digital manufacturing and robotics technology within design in the Ibero-American context.}

abstract = {The use of computational processes in architecture is a widespread practice which draws on a set of theories of computer science developed in the 60s and 70s. With the advent of computers, many of these methodologies were developed in research centres in the USA and the UK. Focussing on this period, this paper investigates the importance of the German Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm (HfG) design school in the early stages of computation in design and architecture. Even though there were no computers in the school, it may be argued that its innovative pedagogy and distinguished faculty members launched analogical computational design methods that can be seen as the basis for further computational approaches in architecture. The paper draws on archive material, as well as at an original interview with Tomas Maldonado, to propose that the remarkable work pursued by Tomas Maldonado (the educational project), Max Bense (information aesthetics) and Horst Rittel (scientific methods) was fundamental in establishing HfG Ulm as the forerunner of computation in architecture.}

abstract = {Learning styles are increasingly being integrated into computational-enhanced earning environments and a great deal of recent research work is taking place in this area. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the computational experiment approach, learning styles, epistemic beliefs, and engagement with the inquiry process on the learning performance of pre-service engineering students. The study used the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), in order to provide information for the relation of FSLSM with the learning environment in order to examine whether the strength of learning styles has an effect on the students’ learning performance in mismatched courses. Our objective was: a) to investigate whether students with a strong preference for a specific learning style have more difficulties in learning, if their learning style is not supported in the learning environment; b) if the methodology of the computational experiment has an impact on students independently of their learning style; and c) if the epistemological beliefs are related to different learning styles. The learning environment was based on the methodology of the computational experiment and applications were developed using the Easy Java Simulator software, while the inquiry based teaching and learning process was adopted. The questionnaire responses were gathered from 79 pre-service engineering students in a higher education institute in Greece. Results indicate that students with no preferred learning style have a better learning performance in mismatched courses.}
