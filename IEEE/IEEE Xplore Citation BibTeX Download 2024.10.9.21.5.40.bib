  abstract={Adaptable Model Versioning (AMOR) is a framework intended to be adapted for versioning of model artefacts. AMOR framework is known for some limitations in the operation and conflict detection process, as well as in the conflict resolution process. This paper presents an attempt to improve AMOR framework using Critical Pair Analysis (CPA), a computation conducted to determine potential conflicts between a pair of operations. CPA computation results are used to detect conflicts between operations and also to determine the conflict resolutions. The test results show higher accuracy for the operation detection process, but they also show a slower performance. For the conflict resolution process, the use of CPA provides a fast and accurate result.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Game-based learning or educational games has a constantly positive impact on learners while offering a variety of knowledge presentations and providing multiple opportunities to be applied during learning process. The development of an effective educational game has been a challenge for game developers to understand the depth and relationships between game play (rules and regulations), game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter (subject content, learners, teachers) embedded in the educational game. Thus, the authors have proposed a multi-domain framework with extracted implicit vaguely supported relationships through a systematic literature review. These relationships are verified through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts to validate the relationships. This paper presents seven (7) implicit relationships based on game play domain and discusses their relevancy with game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach of qualitative study. Consequently, this paper concludes seven (7) explicit relationships in perspective of game play for game developers to reflect on during the development process of educational games.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to explore an affordable, accessible, holistic micro-college model that integrates blended learning using MOOCs to increase access to higher education in the developing world. In spite of the phenomenal growth of MOOCs, people in the Majority World fail to take advantage of them due to several challenges that include the cultural relevance of courses, differences in teaching and learning pedagogy, language barriers, and most tangibly, lack of sufficient telecommunication infrastructure. To address these challenges and maximize the potential of MOOCs for expanding access to higher education, a 2-year pilot program was launched in 2015 in an impoverished area of Nairobi, Kenya to explore a new learning modality combining quality online materials and in-class meetings with learning facilitators. This paper discusses the potential of such a model to scale beyond the initial pilot to make higher education accessible to those with the least access.},

  pages={66-71},
  abstract={Integration of all engineering related information in a single complex product model is one of the main purposes in computer system based engineering activities. Because engineering process highly depends on product development and application projects, its definition was first realized in product modeling environments at the application of product data management (PDM) systems. However, this administrative solution could not be integrated with the content of product descriptions. As a contribution to efforts for integration of engineering process definitions in product model, work in a recent research project theoretically grounded the definition of engineering process entities and their connections with product model entities. The author of this paper participated at that project and considered practical points of view in order to reveal possibilities for the implementation of the proposed method in industrial product modeling environments. This paper introduces an analysis on the role of product model in engineering process and characteristics of processes for engineering process definition. Following this, it discusses definition, integration, coordination, content, product, and background related resources of engineering process definition in product model.},

  pages={344-349},
  abstract={Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems, and for testing algorithms through simulations that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to implement. A model has been devised that simulates the sound localization performance of normal hearing persons, and that is being further refined for simulation of performance of hearing-impaired persons wearing two cochlear implants (CIs). The model is intended to be a tool in understanding the relative contribution of various factors involved in acoustic localization, and in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies. This presentation overviews the development of and results for the normal hearing model, and discusses modifications that are needed to simulate sound processing with binaural cochlear implants. The human head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of the model, and provides the characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects. It defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues reaching each ear that are important for good localization ability. The model has been validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization in normal listeners, and is being further developed to account for differences in the signal pathway and sound reaching the CI user due to sound processing and microphone location effects.},

  abstract={Today digital media such as social networks, chat rooms, and forums have gained much importance in human life for information sharing. Users will share their knowledge and emotions in their own languages. This will create a novel syntax to communicate their messages with as much as pithiness as possible. Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.},

  abstract={World Wide Web is a dynamic source of information which is expanding its content at a staggering rate. Individual search engines are not able to handle the exponential nature of Web. Hence meta-search engines are used to solve the problem of low web space information coverage rate of individual search engines. A meta-search engine is a kind of search tool that dynamically dispatches user query to the underlying search engines, hence providing parallel access to multiple search engines and then aggregate the results to present single consolidated result list to user. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, MetaFusion, has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines fuzzy AHP with genetic algorithm to get more comprehensive and optimized results. Experimental results shows that relevancy of results returned by MetaFusion is more than several existing research Metasearch engines. The precision of MetaFusion is more when compared with Dogpile and Infospace.},

Development of modeling and simulation based product lifecycle management (PLM) systems grounded the realization of such a system during the first decade of this century. The next step is to fill these systems with content in which practice, skill, experience, and intelligence of engineers are represented at a minimum level for successful understanding of a product model in absence of the humans who defined that content. The authors published some results in this topic area in recent years. In this paper, they describe some new methodological elements in order to achieve better representation capability of their earlier proposed modeling. They characterize intelligence in modeled content, explain indirect method for mapping of knowledge at object definition, and discuss expertise and knowledge sources for product model.},

The present study proposes a new formalism for modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will discuss CSS support of the “48h to Generate Ideas®” creativity challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.},

  abstract={A lot of attention has been given to the pedagogical method referred to as "flipping" the classroom. Many previous studies and conference presentations have shown that while students do not perform any worse in flipped classrooms than in a traditional format. However, a thoughtful design of the time spent in class can improve performance. This work-in-progress paper is a narrative of one course's journey over several semesters from traditional lecture to flipped classroom, and the observations of the impact that in-class and out of class activities had on overall performance of students. Brief descriptions of many course assignments and activities are included. In addition, the preliminary plan for evaluating how to create an inverted classroom that can support building lifelong learning skills is presente.},

  abstract={Advanced and abstract concepts of engineering and sciences are difficult to teach using traditional media such as whiteboards and still slides. In the computer networking classroom, teachers have the challenging task of communicating abstract ideas and concepts such as the Open Systems Interconnect Model (OSI Model), Message Encapsulation, Protocol Stacks and many others. Modern teaching methods such as case studies, laboratory experience, visiting real-world scenarios and story-telling are commonly and easily practiced. In this paper we identify the challenges faced by teachers of computer networking in Malaysian polytechnics and study how animated media can be a most valuable tool to use in communicating the abstract and advanced concepts of computer communication to students in this institutions. We discuss some preliminary ideas on the development of animated and interactive media for teaching computer networking and elucidate the benefits of using animated media.},

  abstract={Many conflicts emanate from failure to understand others’ perspectives. Computationally supported roleplaying games have the potential to promote successful perspective taking. When implemented with the affordances of virtual reality, nuances of embodied communication in roleplaying can be more robustly modeled. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a roleplaying game aimed at simulating ingroup-outgroup biases with the goal of supporting positive perspective taking in virtual reality: On the Plane. The game presents players with a simulation of air travel experience, from airport security screening to in-flight events. On the Plane affords the ability to experience the simulation as different characters, supporting both ingroup and outgroup perspectives. We describe how the game is structured to simulate and challenge ingroupoutgroup biases within the context of xenophobia and lay out our plans for future research using On the Plane to promote positive perspective transformation (e.g., challenging one’s own ill-founded preconceptions).},

  abstract={In education, computer learning systems make wide use of pedagogical agents to simulate a tutor and/or mimic tutoring interaction, as well as offering just-in-time and adaptive feedback. Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in the literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation web-based learning system call HINTS to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more effective educational tool. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is reported.

  abstract={Cyberbullying, the act of intentionally causing harm to others through electronic communication, has emerged as a critical societal concern, particularly among university students. With the rapid proliferation of digital technologies, university campuses have become hotspots for cyberbullying incidents, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors driving this phenomenon. This paper presents a systematic review that aims to identify and analyze the key factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The conceptual framework that was utilized to pinpoint the factors influencing university students' cyberbullying behaviours was examined in this study. According to a systematic screening of recent research articles (from 2013 to 2023) pertaining to online bullying behaviours among university students, the findings were given. After evaluating theoretical models and associated concepts, we suggest using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to evaluate factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The findings of this study are discussed, and it is concluded that subjective norms, attitude, perceived behavioural control, social media use, and intentions all have the ability to influence university students' cyberbullying behaviours.},

  abstract={3D printing is a contemporary method of three-dimensional objects’ production. Prior to the printing, the object must be designed in the form of its 3D model - a virtual spatial body. The model is then transferred into a computer program which will control the printing process. Finally, the object is composed using a stepwise addition of micro-particles (grains).3D printing is very appropriate for the individualized production i.e. for fabricating unique objects or those done in small series. A typical lifecycle of these objects is "Design it – Produce it – Make use of it". A growing interest in this extent of production requires preparing enough 3D-printing specialists in a variety disciplines. In our presentation, we discuss what professionals are needed and what modifications of contemporary schooling would fulfil these requirements to a maximum degree.},

  abstract={Mobile learning is an inevitable result of technological progress, which is achieved through networks. Compared to traditional learning modes, using mobile phones for learning is not limited by geography or learning forms, and has great freedom in time and space. This is an informal remote teaching based on digitization and mobile computer devices. Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning. Based on the above issues, this article discussed how to build a mobile assisted language translation intelligent recommendation system using NPL (Natural Language Processing) technology. Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model. The experiment verified the superiority of the mobile assisted language translation system based on NPL.},

A virtual agent moves in a computer's virtual space under restrictions similar to that in the real world. We use a genetic algorithm to simulate and evolve the agent. We then discuss an orientational metaphor that has a basis in physical experience, and we attempt to retrieve clues for solving the generation of concepts by simulating concrete examples, for example, by detecting objects that build a pattern of leg locomotion to approach the object. The pattern is an insignificant set of weight matrices; however, this pattern is grounded in the environment and the body. We then discuss what is represented in the agent action by using the simulation results. In addition, we mention the construction of concepts, such as the GOOD-BAD concept.},

  abstract={Image captioning stands as a pivotal technique for providing contextual descriptions of visual content, promising substantial enhancement in the capabilities of conversational AI systems. This work delves into the integration of image captioning methodologies into ChatGPT, aiming to fortify its capacity in understanding and responding to visual information. The study extensively explores the application of deep learning models, encompassing ResNet50, LSTM, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2, in the domain of image captioning. Specifically, a comprehensive investigation is conducted into a Recurrent Neural Network employing LSTM as a decoder and a Convolutional Neural Network utilizing ResNet as an encoder. These fusion harnesses vocabulary and image features to craft precise and meaningful descriptions of visual content. Furthermore, this study pioneers an approach to identify and relate at least two salient features within any given image, forming a coherent caption that binds the relationship between these identified features. This novel capability not only refines image captioning techniques but also empowers ChatGPT to comprehend complex visual contexts within conversational settings. The outcomes of this work offer profound insights into augmenting AI capabilities, facilitating a deeper understanding and more effective interaction with visual information across various domains, thereby advancing the field of conversational AI integration with visual context.},

  abstract={Music learning is important for preschool children’s musical development, but preschool children are considered to have limited cognitive development and have difficulties understanding abstract musical concepts. Tangible interaction can introduce physical entities into the interaction, allowing children to use their daily life experiences to interact with the computer, reducing the cognitive load and therefore improving the effectiveness of music learning. Combining the cognitive characteristics and physical ability level of preschool children, a design model of a music learning system for preschool children based on tangible interaction is constructed with reference to existing research models, and a set of design recommendations based on this model is proposed. This paper also designs and develops an interactive prototype Music Magician for preschool children to learn music and completes the construction of an interactive action library and iteration of the prototype after pre-experiment feedback. The validity of the prototype is verified through experiments, and the rationality of the proposed design model and design recommendations is also validated.},

  abstract={In research aimed at determining the level of interest of high school students in enrolling in colleges, predictive analysis models and comparisons are rarely applied during the classification and processing of various data. All of this leads to significant fluctuations in college admissions, where certain schools are unable to admit a large number of students who show interest in a specific field. On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields.

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.},

  abstract={Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.},

  abstract={The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \%$.},

Most of the existing clothing design software is a subsystem of clothing CAD system, and its design method is mainly to use the mouse to replace the paintbrush or to use graphics processing software to process clothing photos, which lacks professional advantages and poor practicability. At present, in view of the disadvantages of most fashion design softwares, which focus on simple list of styles and interactive drawing functions, we put forward a digital fashion design system. The garment style can be automatically generated according to the user's requirements for garment style, material and color, and can be adjusted for style change, part increase or decrease, movement and part size modification.

  abstract={Educational simulations can be useful for visualization of abstract and complex concepts and semiconductor physics seems ideal for this type of instructional support. The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.},

  abstract={Creating background music based on vocal sounds using deep learning is challenging. The task involves multiple input and multiple output cases that require lengthy input and output as data. However, training the models with raw data using low-end computers is expensive since training takes a long time and requires high memory. Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.},

  abstract={The commonly used programming approach in teaching computer graphics requires students to learn a lot before they can generate basic and not-so-realistic images. As a result, students may easily be lost in the jungle of programming primitives, and their high expectation fades away quickly. Moreover, the API based programming approach does not support global illumination models. To address these problems, a new approach that combines ray tracing and programming has been used in a junior level elective course, Introduction to Computing with Geometry, with great success. With ray tracing, we are able to cover the camera metaphor, basic shapes, geometric modeling, coefficients of an illumination model, light sources, textures, surface tessellation, smooth and nonsmooth triangles, and algebraic surfaces. A student can learn all the basics and generate beautiful and realistic looking images easily and quickly. This paper details our approach and presents our course materials, exercises, student work and evaluation.},

  abstract={Optimization framework of digital online model for vocal music training based on computer data perception and fusion is studied in the paper. Usually, the training in pattern recognition refers to statistical learning, that is, it requires a large number of training examples to obtain the estimated values of the parameters in the model, while the high-level voice semantic training is based on example learning. With the mentioned models, the signal fusion ideas are considered. With the development of general communication technology, audio AGC technology has also developed from analog circuits to the era of the digital signal processing. With these ideas, the digital online model for vocal music training will be then considered as the novel understanding model. Through the simulation, the framework of digital online model for vocal music training is tested and validated.},

  abstract={Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.},

  abstract={Due to the fast development in computer science new modules and specializations have to be developed, and the Computer Science (CS) curriculum needs to be reshaped in order to include 21st century skills such as problem-solving, creativity, innovation, communication and collaboration. This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.},

  abstract={There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.},

  abstract={In this study, we aimed to address issues related to students' slow writing skills by incorporating the “Out of Eden Walk” project using an AI model. Employing a project-based learning approach, our goal was to enhance students' writing abilities, particularly in the English subject. The research was conducted as a part of the classroom term-end assessment, following the model established by Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology, involving 42 students from Class 11. We utilized a qualitative descriptive method, employing both test and non-test instruments, including observation and data analysis in six cycles. The initial student completion rate was only 11.42%, while the experimental group showed a significant improvement to 85.71% by the end of the study. National Geographic's Out of Eden Walk, led by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, serves as an exemplary illustration of slow journalism. Over a seven-year, around-the-world journey, this article explores how Salopek's Walk not only embodies the essence of slow journalism but also significantly contributed to enhancing students' writing skills through the integration of an AI model.},

  abstract={Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions through modal features such as acoustic, text, and visual modalities. Although existing multimodal emotion recognition algorithms have achieved good performance, in many tasks, features are extracted from the same video for acoustic, text, and visual modalities, which will lead to redundant information across modalities. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms. Ablation experiments show that the input sequence of modality affects the model's performance, with the model achieving optimal performance when the input sequence is visual features, speech features, text features, and personality features.},

  abstract={Experiential learning, a latest popular method to guide students' individual practice, lays more emphasis on cognitive teaching than metacognitive teaching. In response to the above problem, this study creatively proposes a six-stage model of experiential learning for the theme of time management. A 28-day experiential activity was conducted in three classes of the same department. According to the interview record, most participants gave high praise to the overall experiential learning activity. Moreover, the results of the pre-test and post-test showed that the time management competencies of the participants improved. This paper provides a new design scheme to improve students' time management competencies, and to extend the understanding of experiential learning into the realm of metacognitive learning.},
