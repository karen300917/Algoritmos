  abstract={Studies indicate that students, particularly females, find computing most engaging when it is presented in relation to real-life problems, rather than when it is presented in ways that emphasize computing for the sake of computing. Video scenarios are a novel tool for encouraging students to explore computing in a problem-centric, rather than a code-centric, manner. Video scenarios are short films (2-5 minutes long) that depict individuals facing problems in life-like settings. The scenarios emphasize the diverse and often ill-defined nature of real world problems, and the potential for creative and entrepreneurial computing they present. The video scenarios and their associated discussion/exercise questions are freely available on the web at www.Virt-U.org.},

  abstract={Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code. The goal was to ascertain the kinds of mistakes that are often made, and how a technique like this could be most effective.},

  pages={133-138},
  abstract={The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification.},

  abstract={Design of new strategies according to game models has been a general approach from the start. There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.},

  pages={184-188},
  abstract={This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).},

  abstract={The “Scratch4All” project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.},

  abstract={Our contemporary society necessitates professionals equipped with 21st-century skills. Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.},

  abstract={Multicluster Grid has emerged as a major approach for people to pursue substantial computational capability improvement to support large-scale compute-intensive applications. However, it is challenging on how to efficiently manage application execution across the participating clusters, since the participating clusters are geographically distributed, heterogeneous, and self-administrative, and the network connection provided by the Internet is vulnerable in security and unpredictable in performance. The challenges include how to discover resource information, how to handle application workflow, how to allocate appropriate resources, how to make application execution reliable to endure system failures, etc. This paper proposes cluster abstraction to uniform describe and access resources in multicluster Grid. After investigating various cluster resource management systems, a reference description of cluster abstraction is presented to cover cluster computing characteristics, hiding individual cluster details for use. Following this concept, a deployment service is discussed. This deployment service is one of the essential components in ongoing resource management development for multicluster Grids.},

With ABGIS we could explore the dynamics of spatio-temporal systems, particularly, but not exclusively, complex systems. It is possible to simulate complex systems having as a starting point only simple elements (agents), embedded in some type of environment. These agents can inter-act which each other in only specific and very simple ways. As the result of the interaction among the agents and the environment, the behavior of the complex system at macrocosmic level then emerges. According this line of thinking, there are a lot of social, biological, and ecological processes that can be simulated by agent-based models [1],[2]. In this article we give a general description of the desirable capabilities of ABSGIS, describing some features it should incorporate, and presenting some examples that could explore this kind of tool.},

The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users. It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.},

  title={Pattern of Reflection in Learning for Predicting Students' Performance}, 
  year={2014},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={145-146},
  abstract={Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as "processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.},

  abstract={The theme “personal data” is on the rise due to entry into force of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), also known as law no. 13.709/2018, and deals with any relationship between the treatment of information classified as personal data by any means. This article aims to present the main concepts involving data privacy, the fundamentals of the LGPD and the tools and methods to assist in the implementation of the law. To verify the adequacy of organizations to LGPD in Brazil, a survey was carried out through a survey with 216 professionals from different market segments and regions. After the analysis of the survey results, it became clear that many companies are starting projects to adapt to the LGPD and that the internal structures are still small and deserve extra attention in the training of employees},

  abstract={A fluent ability to associate tasks, concepts, ideas, knowledge and experiences in a relevant way is often considered an important factor of creativity, especially in problem solving. We are interested in providing computational support for discovering such creative associations. In this paper we design minimally supervised methods that can perform well in the remote associates test (RAT), a well-known psychometric measure of creativity. We show that with a large corpus of text and some relatively simple principles, this can be achieved. We then develop methods for a more general word association model that could be used in lexical creativity support systems, and which also could be a small step towards lexical creativity in computers.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence explores the means for computers to think like a human. In this era of technological advancements, the unobstructed method for monitoring activities in daily life is a challenging task. Most of the recent research successfully achieved good performance at the high computational cost. With high computational costs, it is not possible to deploy action recognition methods in real-time scenarios. This research work aims to develop an action classification approach for video surveillance with scalable extension for deployment on edge devices. The input video is preprocessed extensively to extract the maximum information about the actions with all variants, which enables the network to even recognize the actions from an unseen environment. The Hybrid Video Classification (HVC) is the combination of CNN and GRU that are used for feature selection and preserving the preceding information, and in the end, SoftMax activations are used to classify the action labels. We have used HMDB51 and UT-Interaction datasets to train our proposed model. The model is tested in real-time on low end laptop. The experimentation shows that the proposed work recognizes the actions with better accuracy at a low computation cost.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. In the last few decades, a silent revolution is taking place. The exponential growth in microelectronic processing power has been achieved by ever decreasing the size of integrated circuits. These circuits which integrate electrical, mechanical and sometimes optical devices, have evolved from silicon revolution. It replaced big complex, costly systems with small, affordable, high performance microsystems. Microsystems are expected to further enable silicon chips to sense, "think", act, and communicate, in essence, to become intelligent machines. Structures of current microsystems are approaching fundamental limits and the next generation of devices might show unexpected properties due to quantum effects and fluctuations. A new research field is developing in which we pursue understanding of basic physics associated with such quantum structures, explore their controllability, and propose new devices. In this talk, we begin with a summary of engineering problem solving and proceed to discuss the impact of technology on the development of newly emerging discipline of soft computing and computational intelligence. The relationship between technology and intelligent mechatronics are pointed out.},

  abstract={Micro-expression refers to facial expressions that last for an extremely short time, typically less than 0.5 seconds. It can reveal a person's true emotion, which is one of the powerful indicators to judge what a person actually thinks. However, the deployment of micro-expression recognition algorithms onto resource-constrained devices poses a challenge due to their high computational requirements. In this essay, we optimize the identification of microexpression algorithms by using pruning-based lightweight methods. By using unstructured pruning and structured pruning methods, the backbone Resnet-18 network model is subjected to local and global lightweight pruning, respectively, where the network structure is optimized to reduce the time and space costs required for micro-expression recognition algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the original algorithm's performance is enhanced following the pruning procedure with fewer parameters, and it exhibits superior performance on the CASMEII, SMIC, and SAMM datasets.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},

  pages={511-514},
  abstract={We present a practical and efficient stereo matching approach which produces a dense disparity map with the pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming in this paper. Firstly, pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on the dynamic programming is introduced where the optimal alignment of two sequences could be acquired by tracing back the similarity matrix which is constructed according to characters in two sequences using dynamic programming algorithm. Second, we think of pixel gray value of all homonymy epipolar lines in two images in turn as two string sequences, and then disparity of corresponding point in two images is calculated by the number of gaps inserted the optimal alignment in every two string sequences. Additionally, according to epipolar constraint we can know that homonymy epipolar lines in two images parallel to the scan-lines, so the 2D matching of images is simplified to that of 1D. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach is stable and efficient, and it has a high matching accuracy and low computational complexity.},

  volume={},

  abstract={Within the context of Argentina universities that have computer science degrees in their curricula, one of the major challenges is to teach an introductory programming course for the first semester. The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.},

In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.},

Crowd RE scales RE by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd RE, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd RE process, itself, by facilitating novel workflows combining crowd and machine intelligence.To facilitate automated techniques for Crowd RE, first, we showcase a crowd-acquired dataset, consisting of requirements and their ratings on multiple dimensions for the smart homes application domain. Our dataset is unique in that it contains not only requirements, but also the characteristics of the crowd workers who produced those requirements including their demographics, personality traits, and creative potential. Understanding the crowd characteristics is essential to developing effective Crowd RE processes. Second, we outline key challenges involved in automating Crowd RE and describe, how our dataset can serve as a foundation for developing such automated techniques.},

  abstract={For enhanced education at the level of University courses such as those in biology or biotechnology, one of the key elements is the need of time and expertise to allow the student to familiarize laboratory techniques in par with regular theory. The Sakshat Amrita virtual biotechnology lab project focusing on virtualizing wet-lab techniques and integrating the learning experience has added a new dimension to the regular teaching courses at the University. Establishing virtual labs requires both domain knowledge and virtualizing skills via programming, animation and device-based feedback. Challenges in the biotechnology sector in setting up a laboratory that integrates both the feel and phenomenon includes the medley of multiple techniques. This paper reports one such cost-effective process used in virtualizing a real biotechnology lab at the University-level. The major challenge in setting up an effective knowledge dissemination for laboratory courses was not only the scientific approach of biotechnology, but included the virtualization aspects such as usage/design scalability, deliverability efficiency, network connectivity issues, security and speed of adaptability to incorporate and update changes into existing experiments. This paper also discusses an issue-specific case-study of a functional virtual lab in biotechnology and its many issues and challenges.},

  abstract={Computers have transformed work and play, transportation and medicine, entertainment and sports. Yet for all their power, these machines still cannot perform simple tasks that a child can do, such as navigating an unknown room or using a pencil. The solution is finally coming within reach. It will emerge from the intersection of two major pursuits: the reverse engineering of the brain and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Over the next 20 years, these two pursuits will combine to usher in a new epoch of intelligent machines. Why do we need to know how the brain works to build intelligent machines? Although machine-learning techniques such as deep neural networks have recently made impressive gains, they are still a world away from being intelligent, from being able to understand and act in the world the way that we do. The only example of intelligence, of the ability to learn from the world, to plan and to execute, is the brain. Therefore, we must understand the principles underlying human intelligence and use them to guide us in the development of truly intelligent machines.},

  abstract={Despite the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, large pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the decision-making process of it in ELBERT. Our code is publicly available online.1},

In this way the process of getting the right information and answer gets faster and also more interesting and engaging compared to classic approach. Along with getting the desired answer faster this kind of approach increases motivation of students to spend more time in learning programming because of interesting new technology that is used as an aiding tool in their programming education.

  pages={744-750},
  abstract={We developed three home-made modeling programs to design thermally assisted magnetic recording heads: optical beam propagation method for waveguides, optical finite difference time domain method for plasmon generators, and thermal/micromagnetic finite difference method for the recording media. These models lead to the following results. To get higher throughput efficiency of the waveguide, the periodic wavy thickness of the inlet can provide better inlet coupling with laser diode light, and the wavy taper shape can improve the propagation efficiency. As for plasmon generators, the model requires waveguide, recording media and main-pole to estimate the correct performance, because the optimized design depends on all of these parts. Our proposed sharp pointed plasmon generator can provide tiny near field spot, and it must have good scalability for narrow track recording. In addition to these optics models, we performed recording process simulation. As a result, depending on the condition of the thermal spot and head field alignment, either thermal or magnetic field can be dominant in creating the final magnetic transition in the media. The signal to noise ratio and the transition curvature are greatly affected by the recording process.},

  abstract={In the music industry, researchers have been developing an approach to music as an informational phenomenon for decades. Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.},

  abstract={Information security risk assessment is the premise and basis for ensuring the security of information systems. Current research on risk assessment focuses on the calculation methods and assessment models of the risk value. Also, lots of automatic assessment tools have been applied to risk assessment. However, these methods didn't take human errors in risk assessment work into consideration, thus couldn't solve the problem brought by the influence of human errors on final assessment results. As a result, this paper introduces the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) which is a mature technique in human reliability analysis into the process of information security risk assessment. Combined with current analysis techniques of human errors in computer science and aiming at the calculation process of the risk value of important assets in information security risk assessment, research on the calculation method of risk value considering human reliability is carried out in this paper. The calculation method of human error rates in the entire process of risk value calculation is proposed. An example is provided to verify the method proposed in this paper.},

  abstract={With the development of The Times, graphic design has developed from the original cave murals into one of the most basic art manifestations of human society. In addition, influenced by the development of big data and artificial intelligence, graphic design is no longer an unrestrained imagination, but a new ecological design presented after scientific data analysis. In other words, the application of artificial intelligence can greatly improve the overall quality and ornamental effect of graphic design works. This discusses the specific application of artificial intelligence elements from the background landscape design, plane interaction, plane color matching and plane landscape virtualization. This paper will be conducive to broaden the specific ideas of artificial intelligence elements in graphic design application, and finally provide a direction for the development of graphic design.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the question: “Can Information and Communications Technology (ICT) helps to improve primary school students' geometry achievements for rectangles?” The applied educational software consisted of a story and several activities with and without the use of computers which were designed following the background of Realistic Mathematics Education for geometry concepts; referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Model’ (PSM). In addition, we use a mathematical test referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Test’ (PST) to explore the use of ICT in the primary classroom for teaching basic geometrical concepts. It is a task orientated test which attends to measure the level of geometry competence developed for students of the first grade. The study dealt with students in the first grade of primary school of Athens and Crete, who were divided into two teams (experimental and control). The experimental group consisted of 113 students, who were taught of rectangles by the support of computers. There were 121 students in the control group, which received only the traditional science instruction for rectangles. Students in both groups were pre-tested and post-tested for their geometry performance for rectangles. The results of the study indicated that teaching and learning through ICT is an interactive process for children at primary school level and has a positive effect for geometry education of rectangles.},

  abstract={Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been successfully applied to solving many problems, but in most cases, they are used as black boxes which are not interpretable. That is, even if an MLP can provide correct answers, we cannot understand the reasons why it makes these decisions. In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.},

  abstract={With the continuous implementation of application services in the field of artificial intelligence in the industry, the academic research on Al branch science is becoming more and more in-depth. NLP, that is, natural language processing, plays an extremely important role in the transition from the in-formation age to the intelligent age. Computer linguistics, a highly interdisciplinary emerging discipline derived from it, is also developing by leaps and bounds. Chinese natural language processing takes the conversion of natural language as the basic principle, follows the research ideas based on rules and statistics, and appropriately adds some reliable examples to complete the translation process. This paper discusses the key problems of computer linguistics based on Chinese NLP, understands the basic concepts of Chinese natural language processing through detailed analysis, and then studies the key problems and steps of Chinese natural language processing.},

  abstract={This paper synthesizes three fundamental challenges within existing frameworks for the ethical regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) identified in recently published literature. These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.},

  abstract={High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is a standard tool to measure the performance of High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC). There are several parameters which can be optimized to maximize performance delivered by HPCC. HPL provides many such parameters for evaluation of performance. P & Q are two such values which determine the distribution pattern of processes for executing HPL. In this paper HPL runs with different values of P and Q have been carried out for three different values of N while keeping the block size (NB) constant. Value of N represents the problem size of task being executed. Results obtained are included in tables and are also depicted in form of graph and are analytically discussed. These results also provide the basis for deeper analytical approaches for HPCC performance evaluations. This critical analysis also reveals that maximum performance is delivered if the task is evenly distributed over all the available cores and nodes in the HPCC.},

In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, this paper analyzes the characteristics of multi-fault emergency repairs under disaster conditions compared with those under normal conditions, proposes a dynamic impact model including weather, repair sites, and infrastructure, also establishes a multi-fault emergency repair model of distribution network and optimization model of emergency repair strategy for distribution network. The simulated annealing algorithm (Simulated Annealing Algorithm, SAA) is used to solve the problem, and through horizontal comparison with common swarm intelligence algorithms such as genetic algorithm, it proves the advantages of SAA algorithm in calculation speed and ability to find the optimal solution. According to the actual data, the methods and principles of formulating the best emergency repair strategy for the distribution network under the disaster background are analyzed.},

  abstract={User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design have a very important role in the development of digital products and services. UX quality is determined by the extent to which the UI developed can meet the needs of users. There are several factors that influence the quality of UX, one of which is its usability. Usability is one of the important concepts in UI/UX design, which aims to create products that are easy to use, effective, and satisfying for users. Lova.ID, a company that sells women's fashion, requires an E-Commerce website system to increase marketing and sales. To find out whether the UI/UX prototype can be used according to user needs, it is necessary to carry out a usability testing and analysis. This study aims to test the UI/UX prototype that has been made. Tests based on effectiveness, efficiency, and user usability use the time based efficiency method and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results of this study note that users can complete all tasks properly to determine the effectiveness of the prototype with a percentage of 100%. In addition, the average time needed to do all tasks is included in the fast classification. And, the usability of the prototype is at level B, which means it is well accepted by users.},

  abstract={Abstract rules can be learned by several species (not only humans). We propose a biologically plausible model for same/different discrimination, that can point towards the neural basis of abstract concept learning. By including a neural adaptation mechanism to a discriminator model formerly introduced in the literature, selective clusters of neurons fire depending on whether or not the stimuli compared are the same or not. These selective neurons are consistent with experimental findings in the literature. Moreover, reward and attention can modulate the relative strength of each attribute/feature of the stimulus, so more complex abstract discriminations can be achieved using the proposed model as a building block. As a formal model, it can be easily incorporated into several applications in robotics and intelligent machines.},

Based on the analyzing and summarizing of current intelligent design methods, an optimization design system with hybrid intelligence, which integrates human intelligence with machine intelligence was explored. Intelligent tools such as genetic algorithm (GA) and case-based reasoning (CBR), were used to find a feasible and optimal solution quickly in a large design space. The way to combine the designer's intelligence during the whole automatic optimization searching process was described. The optimization design system not only integrates the intelligence of design examples, experts, designers and computer, but also supports the designers to utilize all the knowledge resources to design. Finally, a case study is used to specify the implementation procedure of this method.},

  abstract={This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to apply the Simplified Pivot Pairwise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA-S) weighting model with ranking criteria or priorities in determining Employee Performance Evaluation. The method used for the assessment of employee performance evaluation is the center of ranking and ranking order using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), so as to produce rankings that can be compared with the best alternative results with weighted values generated by each method. To apply the MAUT approach in decision support systems, the determination of employee performance evaluation assessment has the criteria of initiative, team working ability, communication skills, discipline, responsibility, creativity and innovation, customer service, and commitment to company values. This research aims at evaluating employee performance using MAUT and PIPRECIA-S in order to weight the criteria based on the assessment of decision makers more objectively. Based on the process of completing the application of the MAUT method using PIPRECIA-S weighting in the assessment of employee performance evaluation, among the 6 employees as the subjects of the research, the best performance was obtained by employee 4 with a final score of 0.435 as rank 1, and rank 2 was obtained by Employee 1 with a final score of 0.328, while rank 3 was obtained by Employee 3 with a final score of 0.251.},

Concept algebra is an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment of concepts and their algebraic relations, operations, and associative rules for composing complex concepts, which provides a denotational mathematic means for knowledge system representation and manipulation. This paper presents a method that shows how the theory of concept algebra is implemented and simulated using typical computers. A visualized knowledge representation tool for concept algebra is developed, which enables machines learn concepts and knowledge autonomously. Nine forms of concept association operations are implemented in the tool to rigorously manipulate knowledge by concept networks. The knowledge representation tool is capable to present concepts and knowledge systems in multiple ways, in order to visualize concept networks by computer simulations.},

The questionnaire is designed from four dimensions: learning motivation, teaching methods, learning methods and learning effects. The results of the questionnaire show that the reasons for the lack of deep learning of computer basic courses are as follows: lack of novel content, too large class size, uneven basic level of students, only shallow learning for examinations and single evaluation method. The conclusion is introducing the teaching concept of deep learning into computer basic courses can change the teaching paradigm for the purpose of knowledge transfer and enable students to deeply participate in and effectively experience learning.},

  abstract={This paper develops an improved TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) based on grey relational analysis and cloud model theory for dealing with the fuzziness and randomness in muti-attribute decision making. Firstly, some concepts of cloud model theory and grey relational analysis were introduced and an improved forward cloud generator was put forward to normalize the decision matrix of TOPSIS, thus the uncertainty of the decision data was embodied and simulated. Then the steps of the improved TOPSIS were described. The calculation method of the numerical characteristics of the cloud model used to normalize the decision matrix was given. The separation to the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution was calculated by grey relational analysis method which can reflect the trend relationship between the alternative and the ideal solution. The weight of the criteria was calculated on the basis of the exponential scale of analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can provide more evaluation information by its statistical nature.},

  title={The Deep Sleep Optimizer: A Human-Based Metaheuristic Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={83639-83665},
  abstract={Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.},

  abstract={In mid-April 2020, UNESCO monitored 191 countries and stated that around 1.723 trillion students in the world were affected by the policy of school from home. It is feared that school closures could hamper the provision of education services and could disrupt the education process which will affect the level of quality of education. There is still no creation of a computational model for the spread of covid as the main framework for schools reopening safely during the pandemic situation. Although there is already a framework from WHO and the government, there is no measuring tool that can evaluate the effect of reopening schools while the Covid-19 pandemic. For this reason, this research seeks to produce a model for the spread of Covid-19 as a basis for determining policies for safely reopening schools during the pandemic. In this research, we produced a recommendation to reopen face-to-face learning in the form of a dashboard. Recommendations are given by predicting the number of cases in each subdistrict using a predictive model. The prediction results are also combined with the factors that have been determined by the government to give recommendations. The allotment of recommendations process involves a critical factor analysis process where we identify which factors are dominant as a basis of a controllable pandemic.},

  abstract={Non-photorealistic rendering systems strive to create compelling stylized effects from realistic images. We present an interactive process using flocks of autonomous agents to model a painter's brush.

The agents leave behind a trail of color resulting in painterly or pencil sketch looking images.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Data Brushes, an interactive web application to explore neural style transfer using models trained on data visualizations. Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to engage with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, `magic markers', mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, `compositing stamps', uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art in order to investigate the versatility and flexibility of the algorithm. In addition to enabling a novel creative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effects particular networks have on different images, or different regions within a single image. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of style transfer features.},

  title={Applying Game Learning Analytics to a Voluntary Video Game: Intrinsic Motivation, Persistence, and Rewards in Learning to Program at an Early Age}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={123588-123602},
  abstract={Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.},

  abstract={Sustainable development is raising increasing interest and efforts are being devoted worldwide in order to introduce the notion of sustainability in the curricula, from schools to PhD programs. The focus of this work is on reporting a teaching and learning experience aimed at introducing the students to the culture of sustainability, by means of a project that utilizes a leading visual programming environment and web 2.0 technologies, and is suitable for a relatively large group. The key idea was to tell a story through a computational artifact, whose development requires critical and creative thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration skills [6] as well as information literacy. This paper describes the pedagogical design of the activities, their objectives, class management issues, and the scaffolds to designing the animated story, to be implemented using a cutting edge, syntax-free visual language called Scratch. Both the humanistic and the scientific aspects were to be covered in each story about a selected topic in sustainability, in order to involve as much as possible of the teaching spectrum and create a truly interdisciplinary environment. The developed Scratch-based solution is also suitable for deployment on mobile devices using the App Inventor visual programming language.},

  volume={60},

  pages={700-706},
  abstract={Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.},

  abstract={Project Jupyter is an open-source project for interactive computing widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},

Each cell was assigned to the processor, and the coordinates of particles residing on the cell were kept in the local memory of the processor.

Approximately 10/sup 5/ particles were injected into a time-dependent flow field obtained by solving the nonlinear system of partial differential equations describing turbulent thermal convection. The flow field was calculated on a CRAY, and data were transferred to a CM-200 through a high-speed HIPPI channel.<>},

  abstract={Processes are everywhere. Organizations have business processes to manufacture products, provide services, purchase goods, handle applications, etc. Also in our daily lives we are involved in a variety of processes, for example when we use our car or when we book a trip via the Internet. Although such operational processes are omnipresent, they are at the same time intangible. Unlike a product or a piece of data, processes are less concrete because of their dynamic nature. However, more and more information about these processes is captured in the form of event logs. Contemporary systems ranging from copiers and medical devices to enterprise information systems and cloud infrastructures record events. These events can be used to make processes visible. Using process mining techniques it is possible to discover processes. This provides the insights necessary to manage, control, and improve processes. Process mining has been successfully applied in a variety of domains ranging from healthcare and e-business to high-tech systems and auditing. Despite these successes, there are still many challenges as process discovery shows that the real processes are more "spaghetti-like" than people like to think. It is still very difficult to capture the complex reality in a suitable model. Given the nature of these challenges, techniques originating from Computational Intelligence may assist in the discovery of complex processes.},
