  abstract={This panel seeks to initiate a discussion within the production system simulation community about a fundamental change in the way we think about, teach, and implement production system simulation. Today, production system simulation, while based on formal simulation languages, is largely an artistic process. We teach production system simulation as a studio course, i.e., students learn an esthetic for production system simulation, learn by example, and their progress is evaluated through studies in which they create simulations. We are not surprised, in fact fully expect that two simulationists will create possibly quite different simulations of the same production system, even using the same language.},

  abstract={In order to assess crowd risk involved with mass of people gathering in large gathering spots, four common crowd flows including two-way flow, heterogeneous crowd flow, circular flow and arching phenomenon were specifically analyzed on the basis of investigation of crowd's route selection. The formation mechanism of crowd risk consists of four stages namely free movement, retention, congestion and stampede, and by using the method of event tree, the important impact of crowd flow on crowd risk was found out. Combined with crowd risk model, the thinking of computer simulation on crowd risk was proposed to provide a reference for crowd security management in large gathering spots.},

In the previous research, we confirmed that the volume of knowledge base does not affect to the performance especially, on precision of WSD. We think the precision is more important than recall rate because WSD is core for other semantic information processing fields and relates to the results deeply. Therefore, we propose an adapted method to improve the precision based on relation structure (RS) algorithm. Through experiment comparing 3 kinds (SSI, RS, and a-RS) of WSD method, we show the performance of a-RS algorithm.},

We have carefully selected eight papers covering different networking topics and designed corresponding experiments for over 50 students to reproduce the research results in the NS-3 simulation platform. In this paper, we present the design of an NS-3 simulation based networking laboratory course by reproducing research results. The course curriculum and experiment design are introduced, the topics of which include wireless networking, software defined networking, and artificial intelligence algorithms in NS-3 platform. The proposed course has been implemented in our university with an online NS-3 lab environment, and fruitful results and positive feedback have been received from both students and teachers. This course aims to teach both engineering rigor and critical thinking for undergraduate students, moreover, help the students to understand key concepts of advanced topics in networking and obtain hand-on experiences in conducting network simulations, which are crucial for their future career or research.},

  abstract={Complex systems may have to meet severe availability objectives related to the importance of the service being provided; such systems must be fault tolerant. Designers of fault-tolerant systems try to implement diagnostics to detect as many faults as possible because, in complex systems, uncovered faults lead to latent highly undesired situations. Unfortunately, diagnostics themselves may fail. Starting from the basics of FMECA, a design methodology and a tool have been developed. It is called DIANA (DIagnostic ANAlysis). The basic idea of DIANA is to perform coverage analysis during hardware and firmware design together with reliability engineering analysis. To this purpose, DIANA has been integrated into the computer aided design (CAD) tools in the same way that logic simulation timing analysis and analog transmission simulation are performed. Two main results have been obtained by the DIANA project: the first is to give the designers a tool that helps them to think in such a way as to prevent uncovered fault situations; the second is to calculate the effects of faults on diagnostics in order to provide transition rates to system availability models when real, rather than ideal, cases are taken into account.},

  abstract={We prove, that a CNN in which the parameters of all cells can be separately controlled, is the analog correspondent of a two-dimensional Ising type (Edwards-Anderson) spin-glass system. Using the properties of CNN we show that one single operation (template) always yields a local minimum of the spin-glass energy function. This way a very fast optimization method, similar to simulated annealing, can be built. Estimating the simulation time needed with our optimization algorithm on CNN based computers, and comparing it with the time needed on normal digital computers using the simulated annealing algorithm, the results are astonishing: CNN computers could be faster than digital computers already at 10times10 lattice sizes. The local control of the template parameters was already partially realized on some of the hardwares, we think this study could further motivate their development in this direction.},

  abstract={Computer science disciplines are very important in the context of an emerging IT industry especially in the Eastern Europe countries where lots of companies invested in research and development sites. The need for highly qualified specialists is very acute and is expressed in several occasions as a request addressed to universities to double the number of bachelor graduates. In this sense universities try to adapt and they provide distance learning programs. In this context all the advantages of software must be used: generative learning objects, gamifications etc. A gamification model for sorting algorithms is proposed in this sense in order to exercise the logic steps of programming and algorithms thus triggering a way of thinking that is needed in the creation of new software. To motivate the student in performing the exercise we used some elements of game mechanics like score and difficulty levels. All the newly created e-learning models are provided to the student through an online Web application.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is a revolutionary model that allows companies and individuals to outsource their data to external data centers which become responsible for their storage and processing. Nevertheless, this new computing model has raised some issues related to data security. In fact, since cloud computing environments are shared between different users, there is definitely a way that a malicious (undesirable) cloud user will find to access and alter other users' data. Ponemon Institute research report [1] has showed that data security has become of great concern to the users who aren't likely to entrust their data to an external company without a guarantee. In fact, cloud users are still unenthusiastic about storing their data in an external data centers and think that storage cloud systems are vulnerable. In this context, several proposals have been presented in the literature to provide secure cloud storage.},

  abstract={Integer sorting is a subclass of the sorting problem where the elements have integer values and the largest element is polynomially bounded in the number of elements to be sorted. It is useful for applications in which the size of the maximum value of element to be sorted is bounded. In this paper, we present a new distributed radix-sort algorithm for integer sorting. The structure of our algorithm is similar to radix sort except that it typically requires less number of communication phases. We present experimental results for our algorithm on two distributed memory multiprocessors, the Intel Paragon and the Thinking machine CM-5. These results are compared with two other well known practical parallel sorting algorithms based on radix sort and sample sort. The experimental results show that the distributed radix-sort is competitive with the other two algorithms.},

  abstract={A simulation-based approach for assessing the reliability of structures has been developed over the last decade and is documented in a textbook. The approach includes computer programs M-Star/sup TM/ ResCom/sup TM/, AntHill/sup TM/ and DamAc/sup TM/ for analysis of single- as well as multi-component simultaneous load effects; and for assessing carrying capacity and serviceability. These programs have been used in several graduate and undergraduate courses in civil engineering to explore a variety of problems from variable load combinations, to design of a frame with a leaning column. Students have found the software easy to understand and use. The ability to easily vary parameters and the existence of graphical output has allowed them to gain insight into the effect of variability on design. The application of the simulation-based approach is not limited to structural reliability problems. The simulation technique can assist in the transition from a deterministic "way of thinking" to a probabilistic evaluation of many problems in everyday life.},

The laboratory notebook illustrates the thought-to-paper conversion process inherent within the presimulation learning experience. Notebook scribblings, characterized by the student as a thinking schematic, are decoded by the instructor for the purpose of developing teaching materials, including new problems that cannot be immediately submitted to a simulator.

  abstract={Tangram, a well-known traditional puzzle, is a tool in elementary education which is often associated with creative thinking. It consists of 7 boards (five triangles, one square and one parallelogram). Using tangram, we could build over 1600 kinds of shapes, such as houses, towers, and animals. However, it is very difficult to supplement a complete graphic with 7 boards. Therefore, this program was developed. In this program, the author used the DFS search algorithm and enumeration method to find all the solutions in the 13 convex figures in the Tangram. Then the author improved this search method to make the search algorithm run faster. The program is built using the Qt application development framework and C++ computer language and uses a user interface to display all the different results about the 13 convex graphics. The result of the research is that every convex polygon made of seven boards is not unique. Some graphics have only 16 transformations, but some will produce 224 different combinations of positions and colors.},

  abstract={Estimation of a object pose from camera is a well-developing topic in computer vision. In theory, the pose from a calibrated camera can be uniquely determined. But in practice, most of the real-time pose estimation algorithms suffer from pose ambiguity due to low accuracy of the target object. We think that pose ambiguity¡Xtwo distinct local minima of the according error function¡Xexist because of the phenomenon of geometric illusions. Both of the ambiguous poses are plausible. After obtaining the solution of two minima (pose candidates), we develop a real-time algorithm for stable pose estimation of a target objects with a motion model. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm diminish the significance of pose jumping and pose jittering effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the pose ambiguity problem with motion model in real-time application.},

  abstract={The functional aspect of the parts and assemblies is the engine that generates constructive solutions that satisfy customer requirements. When specifying design solutions, the designer always thinks in terms of function to be satisfied. However, this information is immediately lost once the design solution is validated. In this context this paper will first contribute to the enrichment of the “computer aided design, (CAD)” modeler database by integrating data related to product functions. Then, it will enrich the data related to assembly constraints by the fit aspect. It would be useful if the designer can specify, when creating an assembly constraint between a shaft and a hub (either through bearings, bushings or by direct contact), the type of constraint fit (tight, loose or uncertain). This information will be necessary, for example, when automatically generating assembly or disassembly drawings. The main objective of the proposed paper is the development of two applications. The first application named “computer aided design part function, (CAD PF)”, used for the enrichment of the parts database by the part function. The second one named “computer aided design adjustment constraint type, (CAD ACT)”, used for the enrichment of the database of assemblies by the type of constraint adjustment during their creation. These tools will be modeled by the graphical “system modeling language, (SysML)” and will be implemented using FreeCAD “Applications Programming Interfaces, (APIs)” which is an open source application.},

The goal of our work is to automatically break the TV stream into telecasts and advertisings and to label each telecast with its genre. One can think the TV stream structuring problem can be solved by an alignment of the program guide on the stream. But our study shows that, in average, only 25% of the telecasts per day are presented in the program guide. Hence, our method consists in improving statistically these program guides in order to reduce the TV stream structuring problem to a simple alignment problem.

  abstract={The Ethernet becomes the fastest growing segment of industrial networking. Due to its high economic interest, at high speeds it will replace conventional fieldbus systems. Indeed, Industrial automation, Aircraft, Railway, Automotive and others domains, are increasingly being controlled via the Ethernet network. Its interest to be used in automotive field, in the powertrain and chassis domains, is growing day by day. Next-generation vehicles will be also controlled based on their interactions with the infrastructure as well as the environment. The cloud computing will be used to exchange real-time sensing and control information through vehicular wireless networks based on WiFi, WiGig and 5G networks. However, these networks are not developed for real-time vehicular control compliance. The use of Ethernet and wireless networks as a real-time control network for critical systems like powertrain and chassis vehicle domains is frequently questioned. Different solutions to modify them to meet real-time requirements have been proposed. This paper is interested to give more details concerning exactly this point. We will demonstrate that Ethernet and WiGig, when adducting the QoS priority policy and the duplication of the controllers in the end-points, can satisfy the real-time requirements when the throughput exceeds one Gbits/s that is, the modifications in each endpoint is quite simple to do. As many may think, the FlexRay network is mandatory for the powertrain and chassis modules and the Ethernet, the Wi-Fi, or its next generation, the WiGiG, can only support the body and multimedia domains. Its comparison with the Ethernet or the WiGiG proves that these latter networks are better when exceeding few gigabits per second for the four domains, with a minimum latency budget. We used the Network queuing theory to do these evaluations. We completed the classical four domains by two new domains, which are the advance driver assistance system and the V2X communications. These new domains are also connected via the full duplex Ethernet backbone, known as AFDX and μAFDX switching elements.},

  abstract={Wireless sensor nodes are deployed to gather useful information from the field but their constraint on battery power leads us to think about energy efficient routing protocols so that they can operate over longer periods of time. We study the advantages of having multiple chains in a network with each chain's topmost node (called the aggregator) collecting the data from the nodes beneath it and transmitting it to the sink. In the proposed scheme, a chain in each region works as PEGASIS. We also study how considering heterogeneity in the network can improve the lifetime of a network by a significant period. We assume that a fraction of the nodes in the network possess additional energy. We show by simulations that the introduction of heterogeneity into the network results in a greater lifetime, compared to those of the classical data aggregation schemes, with the duration increasing with the amount of additional energy considered.},

  year={2011},

  pages={216-220},
  abstract={50 years ago, Gilbert and Elliott introduced 2-state Markov channels to characterize bursty error processes in data transmission. The focus of this work is on the analysis of the effect of bit errors on higher layer blocks or packets. Starting from 2-state bit error channels in an extended Gilbert-Elliott format, packet errors again result in a 2-state process of the same type. The parameters of the packet error process are explicitly derived from those of the underlying bit error process. The solution for main performance measures is based on a superposition of two geometrical functions for the distributions of packet error bursts and gaps and the second order statistics. Knowledge about the solution for 2-state channels is implicitly present in solutions for N-state Markov models by Turin et al, but which require a more complex factorization approach. The latter involves root finding algorithms for eigenvalues and eigenvectors and NxN linear boundary equations, going far beyond what is needed for a 2-state analysis. Conversely, analysis of Markov processes is excluded in other work on packet error evaluation due to the lack of simple solutions. Therefore the authors think it worthwhile to summarize the simple approach for popular 2-state channels.},

  abstract={There are many examples of cases where access to improved models of human behavior and cognition has allowed the creation of robots that can better interact with humans, and not least in road vehicle automation, this is a rapidly growing area of research. Human–robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important applied setting for human behavior modeling—but given the vast complexity of human behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: a successful HRI, in terms of safety, performance, and human satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most sensitive.},

  abstract={The Work-in-progress paper discusses the faculty development model. The workplace problems for engineers in the 21st century demands interdisciplinary skills. To cater to the need, the educators need to make interventions for inculcating interdisciplinary skills among students. The challenge is that very limited focus is on preparing the faculty towards building interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mentoring capabilities. The authors through this paper share an experience of deploying a faculty training model used for training the faculty towards mentoring interdisciplinary projects. The presented faculty development model is a result of the heuristic experience of four iterations and is organically evolved. The model was implemented in the context of a first-year engineering course titled Engineering Exploration. The course uses PBL pedagogy and every faculty, mentors a set of students to complete an interdisciplinary project. The nature of the projects in the course demands knowledge and skills from different domains to be applied at the mentioned stages. To mentor such interdisciplinary projects, faculty needs to be formally trained. However, in the literature authors found very limited architecture in the direction of standard frameworks and models that can be used to train the faculty towards interdisciplinary thinking and mentoring. The paper describes the evolved faculty training model consisting of four following phases where initial phases are focused on improving the technical skills among faculty members while the latter phase is focused on improving the mentoring skills.},

  abstract={In computer’s world these days cloud computing plays very important role. It gives user facilities like group of things such as software, platform and infrastructure services. Virtualization is the backbone of cloud resource sharing. Security is also a main problem of cloud. Multiple users have their own perception related to the cloud. By using cloud computing, user can access resources anywhere by using internet. So this technique is very useful in user’s daily life. One of the factors for cloud computing is cloud services which were provided by the cloud (IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS). These services enable users to access infrastructure, platform and software. Even resources are allocated to users according to their requirements. But many people think it is unsafe to use cloud resources and its services. It is unsafe to use cloud because there is no guarantee of information which is controlled or maintained by the vendors. There are some security issues that are noticed in cloud computing. In this paper, we have discussed a few issues with cloud computing and the challenges of cloud computing. This paper gives overall investigation of security on data, protection and issues in the cloud. The paper also defines the literature review related to the cloud computing issues and threats and also the various security concerns are discussed.},

Problem-based learning (PBL) is a methodology that can help the students to explore and put to use their own resources, and it can be applied to a wide range of students and subject matters. The project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering and computing skills. This study is dedicated to the learning process to help students to deal with the complexity of an electric power network. This study has conducted a new methodology in educational research by adopting technology for teaching and learning. PBL, as an instructional strategy of active learning, was used and adapted for use in Analysis in Electrical Power Systems programme. This methodology addresses many of the concerns of teachers and professional organizations. Above all, it encourages students to be in charge of their education. It emphasizes critical thinking skills, understanding, learning how to learn, and working cooperatively with others. The benefits of PBL in the Electrical Power Systems course are seen in the way students improved the study and analysis of the security in an electrical power system. This method can also be seen as a benefit for Electric Power Systems where educators strive for improved teaching and learning.},

  abstract={Word representation learned from the analysis of natural language does not usually reflect the true semantics of words. The paper proposes a new method, named Visually Supervised Word2Vec (VS-Word2Vec) model to achieve the representation of the relation words that are important in knowledge related tasks. Our method first computes the visual feature vector of relation words based on deep networks, and then achieve the visual similarity matrix for all relation words, which we think reflects their true semantics. VS-Word2Vec model then combines the visual similarity and the CBOW and builds an optimization problem to jointly learn the word vector representation. Therefore, VS-Word2Vec fuses the visual modality and natural language together. Experiments implemented over the public datasets demonstrate that VS-Word2Vec model really changes the distribution of word representation and achieves more effective results in describing their true semantics than CBOW model.},

  abstract={During the early design explorations, designers and architects tend to treat freehand sketching as a mirror of their mind. The spontaneity of conventional sketching is undoubtedly important for the designer's thinking process. CAD systems and the contrived interfaces do not offer the advantage that sketching does. Can modern technology offer a tool that the designers would readily accept for their creative explorations? The study is based on a visualization of a hypothetical system, where the designer develops a representation of 3D shapes of reasonable complexity, sitting in front of a terminal. Using his gestures and limited speech, he inputs into the computer an online representation of shape. This feedback is available to the designer live on his monitor. The experiments reported test this hypothetical system using simulation. Gestures involve spatial movements and they could be more convenient tools for the designers to express spatial ideas. Keeping modeling of shapes in the computer during the act of design as a focus of this study, this paper aims to identify the potentials and limitations of the natural gestures as a source of shape information.},

  abstract={A simulation & implementation of a shortest path from the source to the destination in the amidst of obstacles using configuration space approach both with translations & rotations is presented in this paper.  One of the most important problems in robotics is the task-planning problem. A task is a job or an application or an operation that has to be done by the robot, whether it is a stationary robot or a mobile robot. The word ‘planning’ means deciding on a course of action before acting. Before a robot does a particular task, how the task has to be done or performed in its workspace has to be planned. This is what is called as Robot Task Planning (RTP). A plan is a representation of a course of action for achieving the goal. How the problem has to be solved has to be planned properly. Robot task planning is also called as problem solving techniques and is one of the important topics of Artificial Intelligence. For eg., when a problem is given to a human being to be solved; first, he or she thinks about how to solve the problem, then devises a strategy / plan how to tackle the problem. Then only he or she starts solving the problem.  Hence, robot task planning is also called as robot problem solving techniques.  Many of the items in task planning are currently under active research in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing and Robotics. Lot of research is going on in the robot problem solving techniques. The simulation & the experimental results show the effectives of the method used.},

Non-linear thinking and analogous reasoning, often not logical, have not been considered in this case.It is becoming increasingly common today to use a modeling process for knowledge engineering, which creates a system that can reach the same conclusions as experts without following the same path or acquiring the same information from the same sources. In this paper, we aim to represent Knowledge engineering to transform knowledge into software that makes decisions similar to those made by human experts, such as financial advisors, whose decisions are based on their learning.Eventually, it is expected that human experts will be replaced by knowledge engineering in decision support software},

  abstract={In this paper, a collaborative creation environment for learning activities in a classroom is proposed. It becomes more and more important to think on how learners can collaboratively learn in a classroom, as personal computers are introduced to schools. This learning environment incorporates a typical setting of personal computer classrooms and enables learners to create their own project on their personal computer and share it with others by publishing it to a shared computer. The Squeak eToy tile programming feature is adopted to make scripts for a project and a sharing mechanism of the project is built on the 3D peer-to-peer collaboration environment. Some project examples for this environment are also presented.},

  abstract={The long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to provide machines the capabilities to learn, think and reason like humans. To achieve these long-term goals, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive-like abilities into AI systems to create truly self-adaptive artificially intelligent systems. This marriage of human cognitive skills with “machines” creates hybrid systems that have characteristics of both. The question becomes, which human cognitive model is appropriate for hybrid artificial intelligent systems. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of cognitive models to be infused into a modern radar system to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS). The notion of a hybrid artificially intelligent system can be divided into two main categories: (a) human-in-the-loop systems with hybrid augmented intelligence requiring human-AI communication/ collaboration, and (b) a cognitive computing-based AI in which a fully cognitive model is infused into the machine to allow fully autonomous operation. Here, we discuss the first type, human-in-the-loop cognitive radar systems that provide intelligent decision support and analysis for radar systems. The design of hybrid artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are presented with applications to improvement to modern radar systems, utilizing a Rasmussen Cognition Model (RCM), which we feel is appropriate for a hybrid cognitive system utilized to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS).},

In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry.

  abstract={I'd like to really know how a bird feels when it is flying, just as though my mind was in the bird's body. I think this is a dream that can come true in the next couple of decades. Computer graphics has pointed the way, by showing that we can simulate one human sense-vision. As we refine our synthetic images, we can make similar progress in other senses to let people envelop themselves in richly sensate worlds, both artificial and natural. Computer graphics begins by simulating the physics of the environment under study, determining the light falling on key parts of the scene. We can stop there if our goal is analytical, but to show the result to a person, we need to take a second step and get the image into the mind of the observer. We do this by transforming the computed data into a form that controls devices that stimulate our sense of sight. Computer graphics has validated the model of sense synthesis, showing that we can model, simulate and present an environment so well that, under controlled conditions, neutral observers cannot tell reality from simulation. As time progresses, I expect that this test will succeed for increasingly complex scenes, and we'll extend our abilities to the other human senses.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease is a neurological condition that gradually affects memory, thinking, and reasoning abilities as well as daily functioning. The majority of people with this condition are elderly, particularly those over 65. The exact cause of this disease is still unknown, but it is now thought that it may be inherited, unintentional, or brought on by other factors. Actual assessment, CT examines, X-ray sweeps, and positron emission tomography, are a couple of techniques to analyze the disease, but X-ray checks are the most widely recognized one. Additionally, scanned images from MRI scans are used in this study. This study has established four groups for the condition: healthy, mildly demented, moderately demented, and very mildly demented. The most famous SVM technique is utilized in our proposed model along with a profound learning calculation because of its fast, trustworthy, and compelling activity. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and uniformed through pre-processing. After the information was parted into preparing and testing datasets in a 80:20 proportion, tuner advancement was done to naturally pick various boundaries to improve the model. The ailment and its classification are then resolved utilizing the SVM grouping and the model's exactness is 99.4%. In order to diagnose the patient's condition and discover an appropriate course of treatment and therapy, it helps the doctors identify the disease and the degree of its dissemination.},

  abstract={The growing population has added a burden to the existing power generation station. So what if the demand by the people exceeds the generation capability. The consequence is power deficiency. The world has to remain in dark weighing down the economy of the country. The alternative solution for this is generation mix. Now a day's commercial building is increasing at a greater pace. So in addition to generation mix we are thinking of making it economic. Economic is in the sense of reducing the grid dependency of a commercial building. Through this the cost incurred by a commercial building can be minimized to a greater extent, which can be utilized for some additional utilities. Generation mix includes the ultimate energy coming from sun, wind, tidal, geo-thermal, bio-gas, bio-mass. In this paper, aims at encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as Wind and Solar, available with the commercial building along with grid connection. A case study of National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST), Berhampur, Odisha, has been considered to validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and the result is estimated mathematically and verified through the renewable Simulink Software Homer V 2.81 incorporating present load and forecasted load for 4 years of planning horizon.},

  abstract={This paper presents a preliminary framework using back propagation neural networks for performability evaluation of Kerberos servers. In the modelling approach, keys under pseudo-secure conditions are dynamically renewed and also, temporary interruption to link/server access is involved. This interruption has implications on mortification of system's performance. Since this effects the network communication's cost, an analytical model is created for evaluation. Analytical model's results provide understanding on the values of authentication key renewal(restoration) times, times passed between renewals(restorations) and failures(breakdowns) of the server. Additionally, another distinctive way of critical thinking and problem solving is suggested, and an intelligent system using back propagation neural networks is applied to detect performability modelling.},

  abstract={The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is in charge of the route exchange at the Internet scale. Anomalies in BGP can have several causes (misconfigurations, outages and attacks). Forged AS paths are small scale and subtle attacks on BGP and therefore are hard to detect. In this paper we use a Machine Learning (ML) model applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to take the temporal aspect of BGP into account. We show that our ML model is able to detect forged AS path anomalies with an accuracy of 67% and a precision of 72%. These preliminary results outperform the existing proposals and allow us to think that ML on temporal graphs is worth investigating.},

  year={2014},

  pages={281-282},
  abstract={Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.},

A dance activity was designed as an analogy to the OSI model of a communications system. To identify student perceptions of the activity, a survey was conducted of all students. The obtained results confirm that the students agree that this activity enables understanding and makes the learning process interesting.

  abstract={Recent years have seen rapid gaming development. As development speeds up, game complexity rises. Software engineers are using agile methodologies to enhance output. In this paper, a meta-model-based computer gaming model is shown. The meta-model was created for design reusability, with the purpose of building codes that automatically make implementations in a well-defined manner by constructing the sections individually and independently for implementation. Early game makers had little industry or resources. Space-time game modeling aids in computer game creation describes related topics and provides a game metamodel. Hand-coded parts and regulations make it harder to adapt to different game areas. MDD is an innovative software development method. Some people think drawing is enough to build a model. Diagrams are also needed. Models must have a well-defined, abstract syntax-illustrative structure consistent with met models. Building a space-time model for games allows for model language research. Meta models and OCL can close the design-implementation gap. The code structure facilitates sorting and querying models.},

  volume={},

  pages={1069-1072},
  abstract={Clustering can be a valuable tool for analyzing large amounts of data, but anyone who clusters must choose how many item clusters, K, to report. Unfortunately, one must guess at K or some related parameter when working within each of the three available frameworks where one thinks of clustering: as a Euclidean distance problem; as a statistical model problem; or as a complexity theory problem. We report here a novel recursive square root heuristic, RSQRT, which accurately predicts Kreported as a function of the attribute or item count, depending on attribute scales. We tested the heuristic on 226 widely-varying, but mostly scientific, studies, and found that the heuristic's Kbest-predicted rounded to exactly Kreported in over half of the studies and was close in almost all of them. We claim that this strongly-supported heuristic makes sense and that, although it is not prescriptive, using it prospectively is much better than guessing.},

The ability of computer-assisted diagnosis to serve as a primary screening test for many illnesses, including cancer, has contributed to its rise in popularity in recent years. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that gives computers intelligence by programming them to think like people. In this study, we explore the feasibility of training a deep neural network to provide such a prediction for breast cancer. Information is taken from a UCI-supplied dataset on breast cancer in Wisconsin. Over fitting is prevented by the early halting mechanism and the dropout layers in the neural network model, which together allow for an F1 score of more than 97.},

  abstract={With the gradual expansion of computer network services, the demand of various services for the network is also increasing. In order to ensure the normal and effective deployment of network services, it is necessary to improve or guarantee the key quality of service (QoS) in specific services as much as possible. In the application of computer network technology, artificial intelligence can simulate people's wisdom and thinking, and apply it in mechanical equipment, gradually making the application objects break away from manual control mode and become intelligent or automatic control mode. Internet has gradually become the mainstream communication mode, but there are still some problems to be solved urgently, the key of which is the optimization of computer network service quality. Based on various artificial intelligence technologies, this paper discusses the current situation and solutions of realizing service quality on the network, analyzes and summarizes the principles and characteristics of key technologies of service quality assurance, and finally looks forward to the development of network service quality technology.},

  abstract={We use a digital adaptation of classical Morse theory to organize (typically density based) interpolated geometry in sampled data. The heart of this new thinking is the recognition and cataloging (indexing) of the transition between families of iso-surfaces at criticalities, as the threshold is varied, into a hierarchical criticality graph, with associated zones. The methods work without any assumption that the underlying function is Morse, in the traditional sense. Using our combinatorial approach, we completely characterize all critical points and structures in multi-dimensional sampled functions. We give an efficient algorithm for computing the criticality graph and zones. We demonstrate that the criticality graph and associated zones have a number of important properties, including the following: Each zone has an associated real interval. Each level set boundary iso-surface (at any threshold) is completely contained within component of a zone. A zone component contains an iso-surface if and only if the iso-value lies within the range of the zone. Moreover, for any pair of iso-values in this range, the iso-surfaces within a zone component are topologically equivalent (homeomorphic). We use this software to build a graph of a representative region of the visible human project CT image database as a test case.},

  abstract={Any agent-based model (ABM) involving agents that think or make decisions must inevitably have some model of agent cognition. Often, this cognitive model is incredibly simple, such as choosing actions at random or based on simple conditionals. In reality, agent cognition can be complex and dynamic, and for some models, this process can be worthy of its own dedicated ABM. The LevelSpace extension (Hjorth, Head & Wilensky, 2015) for NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) allows NetLogo models to open instances of other NetLogo models and interact with them. We demonstrate a method for using LevelSpace to simulate agents with complex, evolving cognitive models. We give the agents in a NetLogo predator-prey model "brains" themselves represented as independent instances of a NetLogo neural network model.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how to reveal the cognitive operation of human being from the perspective of granular computing, and discusses the uncertainty, ambiguity and other basic issues of cognition, and distinguishes, judges and identifies its link with thought operation. Human brain can only receive messages of different sensory attributes. A thing's state, movement and change process are reflected by its attributes and change process. Set up a granular computing model based on attributes and the judgment criterion change process and work out the basic logic rules for granular computing. The results show that this method can reflect the identification and judgment process with the attributes of uncertainty. At the same time, messages on granular conversion can be fully expressed through the definition of qualitative mapping, so as to better reveal the essential reason for ambiguous cognition of human. This model provides a new convenient tool for the study and stimulation of human's advanced intelligence and image thinking.},

  abstract={Visual perception is, by large, the main source of information used by humans when driving. Therefore, it is natural and appropriate to rely heavily on vision analysis for autonomous driving, as done in most projects. However, there is a significant difference between the common approach of vision in autonomous driving, and visual perceptions in humans when driving. Essentially, image analysis is often regarded as an isolated and autonomous module, which high level output drives the control modules of the vehicle. The direction here presented is different, we try to take inspiration from the brain architecture that makes humans so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving. There are two key theories about biological perception grounding our development. The first is the view of the thinking activity as a simulation of perceptions and action, as theorized by Hesslow. The second is the Convergence-Divergence Zones (CDZs) mechanism of mental simulation connecting the process of extracting features from a visual scene, to the inverse process of imagining a scene content by decoding features stored in memory. We will show how our model, based on semi-supervised variational autoencoder, is a rather faithful implementation of these two basic neurocognitive theories.},

  abstract={This paper challenges the current thinking for building High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems, which is currently based on the sequential computing also known as the von Neumann model, by proposing the use of Novel systems based on the Dynamic Data-Flow model of computation. The switch to Multi-core chips has brought the Parallel Processing into the mainstream. The computing industry and research community were forced to do this switch because they hit the Power and Memory walls. Will the same happen with HPC? The United States through its DARPA agency commissioned a study in 2007 to determine what kind of technologies will be needed to build an Exaflop computer. The head of the study was very pessimistic about the possibility of having an Exaflop computer in the foreseeable future. We believe that many of the findings that caused the pessimistic outlook were due to the limitations of the sequential model. A paradigm shift might be needed in order to achieve the affordable Exascale class Supercomputers.},

  abstract={Currently, in the field of Granular Computing, parameterized granularity has been widely explored by many scholars. Notably, the multi-granularity model for continuous parameters has also been attracted extensive attention. Based on such a model, it is often necessary to consider multiple granularities to evaluate the significance of candidate condition attributes in solving problems oriented to attribute reduction, which may lead to high time consumption. In view of this, one acceleration algorithm based on multi-granularity attribute reduction (MGAR) for continuous parameters is designed to decrease the time consumption of acquiring reduct. In fact, the acceleration method we proposed is on the basis of the thinking of positive approximation. Specifically, the iterations of evaluating and selecting condition attributes are carried out on the progressively decreased universe instead of the entire sample space. The experimental results over 10 UCI datasets show that the acceleration algorithm not only can effectively accelerate the process of searching reduct, but also can generate the same reduct with traditional approach.},

  abstract={This paper describes our experience teaching discrete-event simulation to several Engineering branches and Computer Science students. In our courses we emphasize the importance of conceptual modelling rather than the simulation tools used to build a model. We think that in discrete-event simulation university courses it is more important to provide knowledge to students to develop and analyze conceptual models than focusing in a specific simulation tool that will be industry dependent. Focusing in conceptual modelling with the support of a well-known simulation software provide the student with skills to create a model and then translate it to any simulator. Our courses use the Petri Net (PN) methodology by incrementing the complexity of models and PN using: Place-Transition PN, Timed PN and Colored Timed PN. A PN simulator is used to analyze the conceptual model and different rules and procedures are provided to match PN conceptual model to Arena simulation software.},

  abstract={Since the 1970's, the scientific field of model-based performance and dependability evaluation has been flourishing. Starting with breakthroughs in the area of closed queueing networks in the 1970's, the 1980's brought new results on state-based methods, such as those for stochastic Petri nets and matrix-geometric methods, whereas the 1990's introduced process algebra-type models. Since the turn of the century, techniques for stochastic model checking are being introduced, to name just a few major developments. The applicability of all these techniques has been boosted enormously through Moore's law; these days, stochastic models with tens of millions of states can easily be dealt with on a standard desktop or laptop computer. A dozen or so dedicated conferences serve the scientific field, as well as a number of scientific journals. However, for the field as a whole to make progress, it is important to step back, and to consider how all these as-such important developments have really changed the way computer and communication systems are being designed and operated. The answer to this question is most probable rather disappointing. I do observe a rather strong discrepancy between what is being published in top conferences and journals, and what is being used in real practice. Blaming industry for this would be too easy a way out. Currently, we do not see model-based performance and dependability evaluation as key step in the design process for new computer and communication systems. Moreover, in the exceptional cases that we do see performance and dependability evaluation being part of a design practice, the employed techniques are not the ones referred to above, but instead, depending on the application area, techniques like discrete-event simulation on the basis of hand-crafted simulation programs (communication protocols), or techniques based on (non-stochastic) timed-automata or timeless behavioral models (embedded systems). In all these cases, however, the scalability of the employed methods, also for discrete-event simulation, forms a limiting factor. Still, industry is serving the world with ever better, faster and more impressive computing machinery and software! What went wrong? When and why did ?our field? land on a side track? In this presentation I will argue that it is probably time for a change, for a change toward a new way of looking at performance and dependability models and evaluation of computer and communication systems, a way that is, if you like, closer to the way physicists deal with very large scale systems, by applying different type of abstractions. In particular, I will argue that computer scientist should ?stop counting things?. Instead, a more fluid way of thinking about system behavior is deemed to be necessary to be able to evaluate the performance and dependability of the next generation of very large scale omnipresent systems. First successes of such new approaches have recently been reported. Will be witness a paradigm shift in the years to come?},

This study combines with the theory of human needs to propose a new needs model for virtual experiment.

  abstract={Solid model abstraction is an integral part of parallel and process design. It is required for simulation and optimisation of the design and consists of retrieving a simplified model from the solid one, with appropriate dimension reduction and details removal. Unfortunately, current CAD systems do not provide the means for easy simplification of forms. Ongoing research efforts on abstraction yield some possible approaches. These attempt to generate the abstract model using expert systems, medial axis transforms or medial surfaces. A feature-based approach is presented. Analysts usually think about objects in terms of sets of forms rather than in terms of geometrical and topological entities. So, given an object and its description in terms of form features, the approach constructs a simplified model of this object using morphological information of the form features. The abstraction process has two parts: simplification and idealization. The simplification part removes any non-pertinent features from the initial model, while the idealization part idealizes the resulting objects according to the goal of the analysis.},

  abstract={In the history of artificial intelligence (AI), primary agent focuses have been external environments, outside incentives, and behavioral responses. Internal operation mechanisms (i.e., attending to the self in the same manner as human self-awareness) have never been a concern for AI agent. Obviously, the learning concepts by which one pays attention to oneself has always been ignored by artificial intelligence researchers. However, we integrated a self-awareness mechanism into an agent's learning architecture, so that not only are an agent's thinking and behaviors closer to the ways that people operate, but also to allow agent-based social simulations to be even more akin to the real world. Our research objectives include: a) to propose a self-awareness agent model including external learning mechanism and internal cognitive capacity combining with having super-ego and ego personalities; b) apply an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game to represent the conflicts caused by public good and private interest in an agents' society, and analyze the effects of an agent's self-awareness capacity upon its individual performance and social cooperation behavior. Our goal is to show the ability of a cognitive learning model to improve intelligent agent performance and support collaborative agent behavior. We believe additional simulations and analyses will indicate enriched social benefits, even in cases where only a few agents achieve limited self-awareness capabilities.},

  abstract={Targeted malware evolved in recent years and that with encrypted payload appeared. The evolved targeted malware is difficult to be detected by static analysis and dynamic analysis on a virtual or stand-alone machine. The key for encryption is generated from information of a target computer. Therefore, the key is only known by an attacker and a victim computer. However, any targeted malware must collecting information of victim computer and we think this is a feature of targeted malware. First, we introduce our proposed method which detects targeted malware with encrypted payload by finding features of the collection behavior with machine learning. As a result, all test samples were classified to benign in our evaluation. We considered that features of our simulated samples are different from those of actual samples. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate of the difference and consider how we can create more precise simulated samples. We created map images of matched n-grams of our simulated samples with actual malware samples. We found hints of more precise simulated samples by looking distribution of the matched n-grams.},

  abstract={For collaborative learning to be successful, the instructor must carefully plan the formation of student groups. Typically, a teacher uses a set of conditions inferred from certain student parameters such as individual proficiency, learning and thinking styles, team-related traits and personality traits. While all of these parameters are instructor-driven, it is also favorable to get the teammate preferences of the students. Based on this, an instructor strategy can thus be generalized as an assignment problem that satisfies the most number of predetermined conditions based on these parameters and the most number of teammate preferences. In this paper, the generic model was implemented using constraint logic programming. Cohorts produced are evaluated based on the parameter constraints satisfied and on the number of teammate preferences satisfied. As such, the study demonstrates not only the feasibility of applying Constraint Logic Programming in the field of computer-supported group formation but also demonstrates that an instructor strategy can both include parameters decided by the instructor and teammate preferences from students.},

  abstract={Lately, deep learning has become increasingly popular in resolving issues across multiple domains, including medical image analysis. This research introduces a process based on deep convolutional neural networks to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and its various stages by utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly individuals can be quite difficult. This is because it harms the brain cells related to memory and thinking abilities, and it's hard to tell apart from normal brain patterns in scans. Detecting it needs a special way to represent features for sorting it out. Deep learning methods can acquire such representations from the MRI data. In this paper, five different transfer learning models are trained in 15 binary classifiers, each of them can classify two of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. This method finds the best transfer learning model for classifying each binary comparison. The proposed technique results in best accuracy of 92% for the AD vs. CN classifier, 94% for the AD vs. MCI classifier, and 72% for the MCI vs. CN classifier, which shows the effectiveness of transfer learning in distinguishing the AD vs. CN and the AD vs. MCI cases.},

  abstract={Evacuation is the movement of people away from threat in order to minimize loss. In deriving a proper evacuation plan, traditional approach or computer simulation may be used. There are wide selections of evacuation model currently made available, which can be categorized into three major approaches. Of all three modelling approach, Multi Agent System (MAS) model is considered as the best approach, in which it provides a realistic insight into evacuation process by including the human factor. Still, it leaves much room for improvement. This paper proposes an algorithm composed of two popular techniques from the field of Game Artificial Intelligence (Game AI), namely Behaviour Tree and Utility-Based AI, which will be applied in the decision making process of an agent. This algorithm is develop to simulate a realistic decision making process that can reflect a human thinking process, in order to overcome the issue of intention persistence of an agent in MAS model.},

  abstract={Ethics should be a practice, not a checkbox. Data scientists want to answer questions about individuals and society using the vast torrent of data that flows around us. Machine learning practitioners want to develop and connect complex models of the world and use them safely in critical situations. Ethical issues can be seen as getting in the way of the core idea and form pain points around managing, using and learning from data, as well as designing human-centric and ethical systems. This is because there is a design gap around ethics in data science and machine learning: the tools that we use do not support ethical data use, which means that data scientists and machine learning practitioners, already engaged in technically complex, multidisciplinary work, must add another dimension to their thinking. This work proposes and outlines an infrastructure and framework that can support in-the-moment ethical decision making and recording, as well as post-hoc audits and ethical model deployment.},

  abstract={The present study is based on developing a Green and Sustainable software because in the present-day computing devices are used for all kinds of purposes and they consume a lot of energy to perform these services. The ICT sector itself consumes a lot of energy so there is a need to think of alternatives that can reduce the level of energy consumption, thus, green ICT practice can be a good option. There is, however, a scarcity of researches that explains how the maintenance of green knowledge in ICT software development may be implemented. Since we recognize that software development process (SDL) plays an essential role in enabling the ICT community, uncontrolled green knowledge in developing software that would lead to the dilemma of failing to satisfy both the community's business and environmental requirements. Therefore, this research will concentrate on presenting a methodology applying an innovative model for managing the green software development and implementation. Keeping this concern in mind the present paper is going to provide a Green and Sustainable software model which can be used in green ICT practices and will be helpful in reducing the energy consumption used by computers.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Mathematics is characterized by its method of gaining knowledge, namely reasoning. The automation of reasoning has seen significant advances over the past decades and, thus, the expectation was that these advances would also have significant impact on the practice of doing mathematics. However, so far, this impact is small. We think that the reason for this is the fact that automated reasoning so far concentrated on the automated proof of individual theorems whereas, in the practice of mathematics, one proceeds by building up entire theories in a step-by-step process. This process of exploring mathematical theories consists of the invention of notions, the invention and proof of propositions (lemmas, theorems), the invention of problems, and the invention and verification of methods (algorithms) that solve problems},

  abstract={As one of the most influential artificial intelligence programming languages, Prolog can naturally express human’s thinking and reasoning process. Thus, it has been widely applied in mechanical theorem proving, robot, intelligent planning, etc. However, the reasoning process of traditional Prolog is inefficient since it requires a lot of backtracking. This paper presents a novel linear reduction model different from the previous prolog derivation--generalized and/or graph search model, which can clearly represent variable (binding) constraints, so no backtracking is needed. In this model, a successful derivation of Prolog corresponds to a solution sub-graph of the corresponding generalized and/or graph. Therefore, the prolog reasoning is transformed into a searching process without backtracking, which can be parallel executed and greatly improves the efficiency of the prolog deduction. Furthermore, we discuss the transformation of artificial intelligence heuristic search technology, which is mature in both theory and practice, to Prolog reasoning, and obtain a more effective algorithm.},

  abstract={This paper integrates the concept of agent negotiation into adaptive learning to support effective learner-instructor interaction. It intends to capture the interactions that are real between learner and instructor, but often simplified or even ignored in most adaptive learning approaches. An iterative negotiation protocol is employed to reconcile mutual thinking and cognitive differences between learner and instructor and then to dynamically produce the most appropriate learning sequences. To delineate the proposed framework, an example relevant to Java programming course is provided to illustrate how the adaptive learning environment with negotiation mechanism can improve the effectiveness of learning.},

  abstract={The deep multi-view stereo (MVS) approaches generally construct a cost volume pyramid in a coarse- to- fine manner to regularize and regress the depth or disparity, which is often built upon a feature pyramid encoding geometry or an image pyramid. A pyramid is an excellent approach to reducing memory, and many papers said even low-resolution images or features contain enough information for estimating low-resolution depth maps. However, recent papers show that the higher the image resolution, the better the output depth map, which means the resolution of depth maps in each stage cause effect on the final outputs. Therefore, we think the low-resolution depth map may not be enough for the high-resolution depth map. In this paper, we propose a sub-pixel upsampling module for post-processing the cost volume to generate a big resolution depth map at each stage. Besides, we also proposed an edge-weighted loss function for optimizing those inaccurate depth values in the edge regions of objects. Finally, we implement them on CasMVSNet, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method. The content of abstract.},
