  abstract={Identification and formulation of a research problem, often becomes a dilemma for a research scholar, especially in his/her early days while pursuing a research degree program. In fact, research is all about thinking of problems and their solutions. This thinking is a process of connecting things and ideas present all around you. If you cannot connect ideas then probably you are not connecting yourself to the relevant research. In this talk, the focus will be to guide the audience towards doing research from surroundings and especially look for interdisciplinary research themes that would connect the scientists and society and probably be more beneficial for all.},

  abstract={Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.},

  abstract={While many initiatives have broadened participation of minoritized youth in K-12 computing education, far fewer efforts have focused on expanding the social, political and cultural contexts of CS identity development. In this study, we propose a “restorying” pedagogy which engaged high school youth in interrogating dominant narratives about computer science through collaborative, electronic textile quilt-making. In our social design experiment approach, we designed and implemented a workshop where 14 racially- and ethnically-diverse youth crafted and coded interactive quilt patches that were digitally “stitched” into a collaborative artifact, with each patch reimagining CS from youths' perspectives (particularly regarding what CS is, who can participate in CS, and how CS is done). By analyzing post-workshop interviews and participant artifacts, we observed that counterstorytelling through electronic quilting can act as accessible and authentic tools to support youth's political identity work, electronic counternarrative expression, and community building in computing education. In the discussion, we address how restorying can contribute towards developing self-authored identities and critical computational literacies among youth and educators, as well as political solidarity within CS learning environments.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of the manufacturing, automotive, robotics, and smart-grid industries will require engineers that posses attributes related to multidisciplinary formation and strong tools to design solutions to complex problems. The engineer's formation requires to include the development of multidisciplinary abilities into their programs and backing the theory with real-world practice. In this sense, specialized laboratories are necessary in order to carry out this kind of formation and training. However, the lack of specialized laboratories is one of the main obstacles preventing us from reaching this objective. The specialized laboratories require specialized installation, maintenance and cost management as well as a design that can accommodate a large number of students. In contrast, the virtual laboratories are one tool that can be used to deal with both issues which are the lack of specialized engineers and the absence of specialized laboratories. This work proposes a new design of a virtual laboratory in order to specialize engineers in several fields such as power electronics, electric machines, automatic control, and information and computational technologies. The laboratory proposed includes tools such as co-simulation, co-modeling, and co-design in order to face complex problems within the industry.},

  pages={18307-18317},
  abstract={Deep-learning based computer vision models have proved themselves to be ground-breaking approaches to human activity recognition (HAR). However, most existing works are dedicated to improve the prediction accuracy through either creating new model architectures, increasing model complexity, or refining model parameters by training on larger datasets. Here, we propose an alternative idea, differing from existing work, to increase model accuracy and also to shape model predictions to align with human understandings through automatically creating higher-level summarizing labels for similar groups of human activities. First, we argue the importance and feasibility of constructing a hierarchical labeling system for human activity recognition. Then, we utilize the predictions of a black box HAR model to identify similarities between different activities. Finally, we tailor hierarchical clustering methods to automatically generate hierarchical trees of activities and conduct experiments. In this system, the activity labels on the same level will have a designed magnitude of accuracy and reflect a specific amount of activity details. This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the details in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some sensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly prohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy is generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper levels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too detailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final prediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can reveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection strategies.},

  abstract={Since the new Curriculum Reform was carried off, there has been a lot of research on teaching mode of programming in high school. On the basis of the exploration of the potentials if designing a teaching mode with the Scratch Graphical Programming Language, this paper builds a situational teaching mode of programming in high school with Scratch. This teaching mode first design a programming learning situation which is familiar by students because of its close connection to the students' daily life with Scratch for student through the analysis of the common elements between the situation and the concept of programming. The n guide students learning in the situation, and transfer back to the traditional programming environmental after he understand the content of concept. This teaching mode can arouse the students' interests of learning; promote the students' learning transfer ability. Ultimately this teaching mode can help students better understand algorithm programming and established their Computational thinking. Both of them play a significant positive role in developing students' logical thinking ability and their ability in solving practical problem.},

  abstract={The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.},

  abstract={Although the research on digital gaming has recently shown that collaboration, problem solving and critical thinking are in evidence with K-12 students who design games; researchers still need to make the case that digital game design content meets rigorous new Common Core standards for Language Arts and mathematics. No class time will be devoted to game design unless proponents of digital gaming can develop and demonstrate this argument. This preliminary data focus on a feasibility implementation of an assessment designed to embed these standards. Three elementary level classroom teachers and their students used the process and demonstrated that (1) teachers can learn to design and use this process and (2) their students demonstrate elements of computational thinking that not only includes the Common Core standards but extends them.},

  year={2013},

  pages={72-80},
  abstract={Mathematics teachers want to enable students to understand mathematical objects clearly and want to use their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. To do so, it is suitable to use both TeX and Computer Algebra System (CAS). Nevertheless, the graphic output of CAS is not suited to the TeX document of the material. To improve it, since 2006, the authors have been developing KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS. The use of both TeX and KETpic based on CAS enables teachers to produce their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. They wish not only to produce their original class materials with figures but also to use the class materials with figures produced by the others. To realize that objective, a good KETpic programming style is needed. For example, when educators produce a figure along with their material by KETpic, they wish to perform symbolic thinking, i.e. they create a KETpic program in a mathematical drawing procedure and concentrate their energy on qualitative improvement of the figures while they recognize the global image of the figure. Symbolic thinking is a factor in good elements of KETpic programming style. The authors investigated other good elements of KETpic programming style using a documentation approach, which is the method of checking teachers' records in detail for their improvement. In this paper, the authors present four good elements of the KETpic programming style.},

  title={Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for CO-OFDM: The Matched-Filter Approach}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={36},
  number={14},
  pages={2955-2965},
  abstract={This paper proposes a novel carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for the coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems using the matched-filter (MF) concept. We consider an OFDM symbol with N subcarriers so that the receiver takes N time samples of the received noisy CO-OFDM signal. Our idea is to first append these N received samples with (L - 1)N zeros at the end to get a sequence of LN time samples. By taking the discrete Fourier transform of these LN samples, we compute the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol at LN discrete frequency points. We think of this spectrum as being made up of L sets of N points each, each set consisting of the frequency points {2π/LN l, 2π/LN l + 2π/N , . . . , 2π/LN l + 2π(N -1)/N}, for each value of l, where l = 0, 1, . . . , L - 1. Each set of N points for one value of l can be considered as the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol corresponding to one hypothesized value 2π/LN l of the CFO. The receiver can now obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimate by determining the hypothesized value that best matches the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol received from the channel. In the case of data-aided (DA) ML estimation, we treat the OFDM symbol as a pilot symbol in which we know the data in all the subcarriers, and this pilot symbol is used as the reference signal for the MF. In the case of blind (BL) ML estimation, the data in all the subcarriers are unknown, and the receiver uses an OFDM symbol with no data modulation in all the subcarriers as the reference signal. After making the ML decision of the hypothesized value of the CFO, a fine search will be carried out to determine the actual value more accurately. It turns out only one step is necessary to locate the actual value of the CFO. The DA MF ML algorithm can achieve full-range (integral and fractional part) CFO estimation with high accuracy, while the BL MF ML algorithm has low computational complexity but focuses on the fractional CFO estimation only. We discuss the complexity and performance of this MF ML algorithm, and present simulation results to demonstrate the estimation error variance for 16-PSK/QAM modulations. The simulation results show that the estimation error variance of the DA MF ML algorithm can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the absence of the laser phase noise.},

  abstract={Physical space appeared with the birth of the earth. With the emergence of social space, thinking space, and cyberspace (STCs), things in physical space are continuously enriched. Consequently, the PhiNet, an abstracted network concept such as relationships between things, is becoming more complex. Physical space plays a fundamental role in promoting the connection and development with the other three spaces. We think that PhiNet of Things (PoT) is a unified description of pure physical space and the evolving physical space affected by STCs. While the Internet of Things (IoT) is described from a cyber view, in this article, the definition of PoT is put forward from a natural view. Besides, the evolution of PoT is identified by the time sequence in which the four spaces appeared. At each stage, research is carried out from two perspectives of things and PhiNet, and two specific examples are presented to illustrate the change process of things and the related PhiNet. In addition, two applications are listed to explain the usability of PoT in the current development stage. Finally, the article gives the possible future development direction of PoT. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the fundamental role of physical space in the continuous development through time sequence.},

  abstract={This paper summarizes an event which brought together modeling experts, users, potential users and healthcare management practitioners to explore the question of evidence in the field of healthcare: how it is, and how it should be, used. The paper is an abridged version of a full report on the event. The paper highlights the high status accorded to empirical evidence (generated, in particular by randomized controlled trials), and suggests that a more balanced view of evidence, as being composed of empiricist, rationalist, and historicist material, is of value. Modeling and simulation constitute sources of rationalist evidence. Tensions between different types of evidence are identified, and the tension between statistics and stories as evidential forms is explored. The paper concludes on an optimistic note: there are clear signs that within the UK National Health Service, modeling and simulation are being taken more seriously as sources of evidence.},

  abstract={We describe trial applications of fuzzy sets to data retrieval. The objectives are to test their ability to achieve conceptual matching between retrieved objects and the user's intention and to connect real data with symbolic notations. The algorithm proposed retrieves data that conceptually fit the meanings of the entered keyword. An algorithm is described that uses fuzzy sets to handle word ambiguity (the main cause of vagueness in the meaning of a word). It is based on conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs), which represent the meaning of words by chaining other related words. Two trial applications of this algorithm to data retrieval are described. First, an application to image retrieval shows variation of data retrieval with conceptual matching and transformation of numeric values into symbols. Next, an application to the agent recommending a TV program shows the method that lets CFSs fit to the sense of a user by Hebbian learning.},

  title={Genetic Algorithm Optimization of Teams for Heterogeneity}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives." Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender. While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization.},

  abstract={It is one of a teacher's challenges in lesson planning to consider all levels of learning involving students' team skills while taking the actual subject content into account. This descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.},

  abstract={Full paper, Research-to-Practice. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics.},

  abstract={Japan's elementary school educators are facing the difficult task of teaching computer programming education and computational thinking in a playful way which affords students' time to acquire new knowledge while discovering new technology. Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students.},

  abstract={While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.},

  abstract={Computer science education in primary and secondary schools uses the. visual programming language "Scratch " to learn computational thinking. However, the limited number of course hours and overwhelmed teachers delay students’ learning progression. Although many Scratch instructional videos are available online, students still fail because of a lack of keyword-searching ability. Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning "Scratch." This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need. We believe that through this recommendation system, intelligent hints in the form of videos can cultivate students’ self-learning ability and improve current teaching adversity.},

  abstract={Programming, most recently in the form of Computational Thinking (CT), is emerging as a new subject in primary schools worldwide. By data-based decision making, teachers, as learning designers, make decisions on instruction design based on a broad range of evidence, such as student assessment scores and classroom teaching observations. Given the current limitations on conclusive, field-proven teaching practices and an underlying “culture” to use as a basis, we turn to pertinent empirical studies that the growing scientific interest on introducing programming in primary school curricula has produced. The hypothesis is that we may overcome the lack of extensive experience in designing a programming course by reviewing the above evidence, in order to frame learning situations and methods.},

  abstract={There is a need to increase the number of students, especially women, choosing programming and STEM disciplines. We need innovative approaches in schools to better engage students and awake their interest in computer science. This paper addresses the need to create tools that effectively support the learning of programming and the development of computational thinking, highlighting why video games can be an effective educational tool for it and also attract new students to STEM. The Game4Coding Erasmus+ project proposes the design of a video game called CodeQuest, using a game genre that has not been frequently used before to address the teaching of programming, the monster tamer genre. We consider that video games have a number of benefits such as that stimulate active learning, are engaging for a wide range of students, and present information in a way that is attractive to learners. We want to explore this kind of game's effectiveness as a learning tool as well as its effect on the perception of STEM disciplines and programming to attract new public to coding (especially girls).},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been widely integrated into K-12 classrooms through programming education. Numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. Blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for K-12 programming courses. With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. Suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices.},

  abstract={In recent years, a tremendous amount of effort has been devoted to modeling the cognition of human brain, particularly hypothesis generation process. Most research of the hypothesis generation model is probability-based. However, computation of human brains is still neuron-based instead of calculating the probability. As an attempt to solve this problem in this paper, we propose a novel neuron-based hypothesis generation model, called hypothesis generation net, to model human cognition, including how to make decisions and how to do actions. Basically, the proposed hypothesis generation model consists of two parts, i.e., a hypothesis model and an evaluation model. When these two models interact, the system is able to generate hypotheses to solve complex tasks based on historical experiences. To validate the feasibility of the proposed hypothesis generation model, we show a virtual robot with its cognition system can learn how to write Chinese calligraphy in a simulation environment, where an image-to-action translation via a cognitive framework is proposed to learn the pattern of Chinese characters. Based on the proposed deep thinking and learning mechanism, the virtual robot is able to write Chinese calligraphy well, which is a difficult task requiring extremely complicated motions, through thinking and practicing according to a human writing sample.},

  abstract={In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.},

  abstract={Our objective is language-based search of large-scale image and video datasets. For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and reranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art. We also extend our method to the video domain, improving the state of the art on the VATEX dataset.},

  pages={329-338},
  abstract={Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible changes to input pixels that can change the prediction of deep learning models. Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.},

  abstract={Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the objective function is a black box. However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these “grey-box” BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called “white-box” first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.},

  abstract={Neural models of code are successfully tackling various prediction tasks, complementing and sometimes even outperforming traditional program analyses. While most work focuses on end-to-end evaluations of such models, it often remains unclear what the models actually learn, and to what extent their reasoning about code matches that of skilled humans. A poor understanding of the model reasoning risks deploying models that are right for the wrong reason, and taking decisions based on spurious correlations in the training dataset. This paper investigates to what extent the attention weights of effective neural models match the reasoning of skilled humans. To this end, we present a methodology for recording human attention and use it to gather 1,508 human attention maps from 91 participants, which is the largest such dataset we are aware of. Computing human-model correlations shows that the copy attention of neural models often matches the way humans reason about code (Spearman rank coefficients of 0.49 and 0.47), which gives an empirical justification for the intuition behind copy attention. In contrast, the regular attention of models is mostly uncorrelated with human attention. We find that models and humans sometimes focus on different kinds of tokens, e.g., strings are important to humans but mostly ignored by models. The results also show that human-model agreement positively correlates with accurate predictions by a model, which calls for neural models that even more closely mimic human reasoning. Beyond the insights from our study, we envision the release of our dataset of human attention maps to help understand future neural models of code and to foster work on human-inspired models.},

  abstract={We present a comprehensive study on a new task named image color aesthetics assessment (ICAA), which aims to assess color aesthetics based on human perception. ICAA is important for various applications such as imaging measurement and image analysis. However, due to the highly diverse aesthetic preferences and numerous color combinations, ICAA presents more challenges than conventional image quality assessment tasks. To advance ICAA research, 1) we propose a baseline model called the Delegate Transformer, which not only deploys deformable transformers to adaptively allocate interest points, but also learns human color space segmentation behavior by the dedicated module. 2) We elaborately build a color-oriented dataset, ICAA17K, containing 17K images, covering 30 popular color combinations, 80 devices and 50 scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 1,500 people. Moreover, we develop a large-scale benchmark of 15 methods, the most comprehensive one thus far based on two datasets, SPAQ and ICAA17K. Our work, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but more importantly offers the community a roadmap to explore solutions for ICAA. Code and dataset are available in here.},

  abstract={Cyber security experts in the U.S. and around the globe assess potential threats to their organizations by evaluating potential attackers' skills, knowledge, resources, access to the target organization and motivation to offend (i.e. SKRAM). Unfortunately, this model fails to incorporate insights regarding online offenders' traits and the conditions surrounding the development of online criminal event. Drawing on contemporary criminological models, we present a theoretical rationale for revising the SKRAM model. The revised model suggests that in addition to the classical SKRAM components, both individual attributes and certain offline and online circumstances fuel cyber attackers' motivation to offend, and increase the probability that a cyber-attack will be launched against an organization. Consistent with our proposed model, and its potential in predicting the occurrence of different types of cyber-dependent crimes against organizations, we propose that Information Technology professionals' efforts to facilitate safe computing environments should design new approaches for collecting indicators regarding attackers' potential threat, and predicting the occurrence and timing of cyber-dependent crimes.},

  pages={797-816},
  abstract={Proof-of-Learning (PoL) proposes that a model owner logs training checkpoints to establish a proof of having expended the computation necessary for training. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing—computing a proof for a stolen model—is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has invalidated this observation.In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of PoL—meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof. On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to open problems in learning theory. We conclude that one cannot develop a provably robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization in deep learning.},

Two metrics, MQ-Repres and MQ-Discri are developed accordingly to evaluate the model quality, and also provide a new confidence estimation called MQ-Conf for online inference. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by the $3D$ semantic segmentation tasks using three different deep networks.

  abstract={Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.},

  pages={416-427},
  abstract={RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate biological functions by interacting with specific RNAs, and play an important role in many life activities. Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance.

  abstract={The design process is often characterized by and realized through the iterative steps of evaluation and refinement. When the process is based on a single creative domain such as visual art or audio production, designers primarily take inspiration from work within their domain and refine it based on their own intuitions or feedback from an audience of experts from within the same domain. What happens, however, when the creative process involves more than one creative domain such as in a digital game? How should the different domains influence each other so that the final outcome achieves a harmonized and fruitful communication across domains? How can a computational process orchestrate the various computational creators of the corresponding domains so that the final game has the desired functional and aesthetic characteristics? To address these questions, this paper identifies game facet orchestration as the central challenge for artificial-intelligence-based game generation, discusses its dimensions, and reviews research in automated game generation that has aimed to tackle it. In particular, we identify the different creative facets of games, propose how orchestration can be facilitated in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, review indicative preliminary examples of orchestration, and conclude by discussing the open questions and challenges ahead.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected appliances, sensors, and databases that aim to improve human life quality in various life fields. To enhance agricultural productivity quantitively and in terms of quality, farmers have adopted the emerging IoT and communication technologies to establish automated monitoring and control systems. This adoption of novel technologies enables farmers to deal with traditional practice problems. However, the solutions provided by this new concept reveal a wide range of research issues. Since security and privacy are the top concerns in IoT environments, it's important to think about potential attacks and develop countermeasures. In this paper, we present a simple security analysis in the IoT-based smart agriculture field. Then, considering the crucial role of authentication in IoT security, we reviewed the different classes of authentication in this field.},

  abstract={This paper describes the outcomes of a three-day teacher professional development workshop aimed at introducing concepts, principles and practices of computational thinking. The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education.},

  abstract={Coding (programming) is a skill that nowadays is considered as an important asset. Teaching programming is an activity that becomes more and more popular. In the last few years there are great discussions on inclusion of coding in schools. These initiatives impacted the policy makers in Macedonia to include coding as a part of a new compulsory subject for the pupils at the age of 8. In this paper our focus is on the newest change in the Macedonian curriculum - the introduction of the course "Working with computers and basics of programming", which can be shortly named as "Computing" in 2015. Here, we present the proposed and accepted curriculum with emphasis on the topics about computational thinking and programming. Then we discuss the available software and tools suitable for the implementation of the before mentioned topics, and present a newly developed game. At the end we explain the background of the teachers, give the format of the preliminary training of all primary school teachers in the country and present the first impressions of the trainers that conducted the training, and we elaborate the teachers' feedback.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an emergent system in which an autonomous mobile robot can acquire environment oriented behavior. In the general robotic engineering, a system designer gave the model of environment and sensory-motor commands beforehand. However, we think that the autonomous robot has to be developed through the interaction between robot's behavior and the environmental information by itself. So, we construct the controller for the autonomous robot to acquire the adaptive behavior with the chaotic neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, we make use of the dynamic learning method (DLM) as an on-line learning method. The results of the computational experiments show the chaotic search of this network plays an important role for the acquisition of the adaptive behavior.},

  abstract={As a summer camp for middle school and high school students, a new method of learning/teaching computer science was explored: Teaching high schoolers MIT's App Inventor for 2 weeks and then during the following two weeks, having the high schoolers teach middle schoolers ranging from upcoming 6th to 9th graders. The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with. This paper presents the organization of the summer programming camp, contents and learning outcome.},

  abstract={We introduce a new research area in visual analytics (VA) aiming to bridge existing gaps between methods of interactive machine learning (ML) and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), on one side, and human minds, on the other side. The gaps are, first, a conceptual mismatch between ML/XAI outputs and human mental models and ways of reasoning, and second, a mismatch between the information quantity and level of detail and human capabilities to perceive and understand. A grand challenge is to adapt ML and XAI to human goals, concepts, values, and ways of thinking. Complementing the current efforts in XAI towards solving this challenge, VA can contribute by exploiting the potential of visualization as an effective way of communicating information to humans and a strong trigger of human abstractive perception and thinking. We propose a cross-disciplinary research framework and formulate research directions for VA.},

  abstract={One argument in the discussion about the adoption of UML in industry is the supposedly large effort it takes to do modeling. Our study explores how the creation of UML models can be understood to consist of different cognitive activities: (i) designing: thinking about the design (ideation, key-design decision making), (ii) notation expression: expressing a design in a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in a diagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of 100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on software models as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% of the effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing. Notation expression is around 41% of the model creation effort and layouting is in the order of 3%. This finding suggests that a significant part of creating models is devoted to design thinking about the problem.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) are being criticized for copyright infringement, inadvertent bias in training data, a danger to human innovation, the possibility of distributing incorrect or misleading information, and prejudice. Due to their popularity among students, the introduction of many comparable apps, and the inability to resist unfair and fraudulent student usage, their educational use needs to be adapted and harmonized. The incorporation of LLMs should be defined not only by pedagogues and educational institutions, but also by students who will actively utilize them to learn and prepare assignments. In order to find out what students from two universities think and suggest about LLMs use in education, they were asked to give their contribution by answering the survey that was conducted at the beginning of the spring semester of academic 2022/23. Their feedback was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, showing in a better light what students think about LLMs and how and why they would use them. Based on the analysis, the authors propose an original strategy for integrating LLMs into education. The proposed approach is also adapted for those students who are not interested in using LLMs and for those who prefer the hybrid mode by combining their own research with LLMs generated recommendations. The authors expect that by implementing the proposed strategy, schools will benefit from a better education in which research, creativity, academic honesty, recognition of false information, and the ability to improve knowledge will prevail.},

  abstract={Previous terrorist attacks, system failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that many States face in preparing for national civil contingencies. The diversity of critical infrastructures and the interconnections between different systems makes it difficult for planners to 'think of everything'. For example, the loss of power distribution networks can disrupt rail and road transportation systems. Knock-on effects can also be felt across telecommunications infrastructures as the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS') that protect Internet routers and mobile phone base stations fail over time. Domestic water supplies are affected when pumping and treatment centres lose power. These interconnections make it hard to anticipate the many different safety-related systems that might be affected by particular contingencies. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System that is intended to help government agencies plan for the knock-on effects that propagate between major infrastructures. The intention is to provide a flexible system, which can easily be configured and updated. This is important given that technical innovation and routine maintenance continually introduce changes across national infrastructures.},

  year={2008},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Previous terrorist attacks, infrastructure failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that states face in preparing for civil contingencies. One aspect of this is that the agencies which typically coordinate the protection of critical infrastructures have a national responsibility. However, the impact of particular failures is often focused at a local or regional level. For example, Hurricane Katrina was most acutely felt in the City of New Orleans (over 350,000 people affected), with concentrations in suburban Jefferson Parish (175,000) and St. Bernard Parish (53,000) and along the Mississippi Coast (54,000). The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the UK floods of 2007 also show how multiple localised contingencies can occur at the same time. National infrastructure protection agencies must, therefore, be prepared to provide simultaneous help to multiple local agencies. It is for this reason that national civil protection bodies provide national guidance but then devolve responsibility for the implementation of contingency plans to a local level. Unfortunately, many of the regional groups who are responsible for infrastructure protection have little or no idea about the detailed inter-relationships that exist between their own local infrastructures. For example, in the UK 'risk registers' enumerate local hazards without considering how, for example, an attack on a gas storage facility might damage power distribution infrastructures. Nor do they consider the knock-on effects that such damage might have upon water pumping and purification systems. This paper introduces a geographic information system that is intended to help identify dependencies between local critical infrastructures. Although we focus on supporting interaction between local and national contingency planning within the United Kingdom, similar problems affect many other nations. The goal is to support the 'joined up' thinking that is often recommended in the aftermath of previous failures.},

  abstract={Existing studies on the propagation of infectious diseases have not sufficiently considered the uncertainties that are related to individual behavior and its influence on individual decision making to prevent infections, even though it is well known that changes in behavior can lead to variations in the macrodynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. These influencing factors can be categorized into emotion-related and cognition-related components. We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example. We find that individual decision making against infections (frequent washing, respirator usage, and crowd contact avoidance) can significantly decrease the at-peak number of infected patients, even when common policies, such as isolation and vaccination, are not deployed.},

A computational experiment system is developed by using MatLab, SimPowerSystems and Opal-RT real-time simulation system for fast and accurate performance evaluations of PV arrays under high frequency switching conditions of power converters.

  number={1},
  pages={24-35},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection and system level power reduction of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) Edge sensors. The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.},

One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people.},

  pages={95109-95122},
  abstract={Classifying the cognitive levels of assessment questions according to Bloom’s taxonomy can help instructors design effective assessments that are well aligned with the intended learning outcomes. However, the classification process is time consuming and requires experience. Many studies have attempted to automate the process by utilizing different machine learning and text mining approaches, but none has examined the classification of Arabic questions. The purpose of this study is to examine this research gap and to introduce a new feature extraction method that would better suit Arabic questions and their unique characteristics. It also aims to provide Arab instructors with a tool that can help them automatically classify their assessment questions. To accomplish this purpose, the study developed a dataset of more than 600 Arabic assessment questions. It then proposed a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method for extracting features from Arabic questions. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, the proposed method was designed to take the nature of assessment questions into consideration. It was evaluated by comparing it to two methods that have been used for classifying English questions, i.e., the traditional TF-IDF and a modified TF-IDF method called term frequency part-of-speech-inverse document frequency (TFPOS-IDF). A t-test was utilized to examine whether the difference in performance between the three methods was statistically significant. The proposed method outperformed the two other methods. The overall accuracy, precision, and recall scored by the proposed method were significantly higher than those scored by the traditional TF-IDF and TFPOS-IDF methods. The evaluation results indicate the promising potential of the proposed method, which can be extended to other languages.},

  title={Industry 4.0 and Higher Education: An Evaluation of Barriers Affecting Master’s in Business Administration Enrolments Using a Grey Incidence Analysis},

  abstract={Higher education confers numerous benefits both to the individual and to society, including higher earnings, lower rates of unemployment and government dependency, an increased tax base, and greater civic engagement. Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier “employment difficulties” (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are “lack of entrepreneurship skills” (H11), “high cost” (H10), “longer payback duration” (H1), “10 yr. ROI” (H9), and “lack of data analytic skills” (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them. This paper also contributes to the literature a first-hand, formal study on the prioritization of barriers to international MBA enrolments.},

  abstract={Business and data understanding, that aims to identify multiple mining tasks, is the most primary phase in planning a practical data mining project. However, traditional tasks determination problem could only be solved by experienced analysts, which suffers from high communication cost and low efficiency. In this paper, we study the automatic task discovery method following the problem solving theory. First, we establish the concept network (CN) model to represent human knowledge and experience in the problem solving process. Then, we propose and demonstrate the structure of two major mining tasks (clustering and classification) in a CN. Finally, a data mining tasks discovery method (DMTD) is put forward, followed by two analysis subject evaluation algorithms. Experiment results illustrate that the DMTD is able to discover all the potential mining tasks from a predefined concept network, filtered by the important or interesting analysis subjects. Moreover, these tasks defined by the DMTD are proven to be available and valuable by fifty published papers.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={102261-102273},
  abstract={In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={581-586},
  abstract={This study explains the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for `fun-based' interactive programming instruction in engineering education courses. Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.'},

  abstract={This paper discusses how Social Digital Literacy is being used in CS1 to teach critical and computational thinking by delivering content to students through the use of social media. Social Digital Literacy (SDL) is the way in which people use social media to enhance their social network, effectively increase their knowledge base, while communicating clearly and professionally through the use of social media. The increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. In order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. By increasing their SDL proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media. The expectation is that the approach being used can be implemented in any introductory programming course.},

  abstract={Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.},

  abstract={Mamdani inference model is widely used in that kind of engineering applications, in which imprecision, subjectivity, or uncertainty should be handled in the data and in the evaluation process. Its popularity is coming from its operation is very close to the human thinking. Although, it has high computational needs. Final step of the conventional model is the defuzzification, where a crisp value is assigned to the aggregated result of the system to represent it. This value should be selected in such a way as to best represent the result of the evaluation. For this reason, to select the best fitted defuzzification method is essential. In this paper two of the commonly used defuzzification methods are introduced, and a correction value is proposed to improve the result of MOM (Mean of Maxima) defuzzification method. The proposed modification was studied both in the conventional Mamdani, and Mamdani-like model using discretized output.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},

  abstract={How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

The proposed research aims to improve the CH experience using extended reality (XR) technologies by investigating the digital affordances of XR technologies that can support the design of playful CH experience, and exploring appropriate ways to enable user-generated content for participatory CH experience. This is an interdisciplinary project that sits at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), XR, and CH. A practice-based approach will be adopted to conduct research in the wild, designing and developing novel XR interfaces and interaction techniques for CH experiences. The combined design thinking and computational approach will allow an in-depth understanding of playful and participatory CH experience using XR technologies, providing empirical, artifact, and theoretical contributions to the fields of HCI, XR, and CH.},

  title={A Type-2 Fuzzy Ontology and Its Application to Personal Diabetic-Diet Recommendation}, 
  year={2010},
  volume={18},
  number={2},
  pages={374-395},
  abstract={ It has been widely pointed out that classical ontology is not sufficient to deal with imprecise and vague knowledge for some real-world applications like personal diabetic-diet recommendation. On the other hand, fuzzy ontology can effectively help to handle and process uncertain data and knowledge. This paper proposes a novel ontology model, which is based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), called type-2 fuzzy ontology (T2FO), with applications to knowledge representation in the field of personal diabetic-diet recommendation. The T2FO is composed of 1) a type-2 fuzzy personal profile ontology ( type-2 FPPO); 2) a type-2 fuzzy food ontology ( type-2 FFO); and 3) a type-2 fuzzy-personal food ontology (type-2 FPFO). In addition, the paper also presents a T2FS-based intelligent diet-recommendation agent ( IDRA), including 1) T2FS construction; 2) a T2FS-based personal ontology filter; 3) a T2FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism; 4) a  T2FS-based diet-planning mechanism; 5) a T2FS-based menu-recommendation mechanism; and 6) a T2FS-based semantic-description mechanism. In the proposed approach, first, the domain experts plan the diet goal for the involved diabetes and create the nutrition facts of common Taiwanese food. Second, the involved diabetics are requested to routinely input eaten items. Third, the ontology-creating mechanism constructs a T2FO, including a type-2 FPPO, a type-2 FFO, and a set of type-2 FPFOs. Finally, the  T2FS-based IDRA retrieves the built T2FO to recommend a personal diabetic meal plan. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can work effectively and that the menu can be provided as a reference for the involved diabetes after diet validation by domain experts. },

  abstract={Mathematical knowledge is now often presented in a fragmented form. The problem is how to provide not just a sum of knowledge about the individual elements of mathematics, and some holistic system of representations of the world of mathematics. Integral system of ideas about the general properties and regularities of the objective world, a special form of systematization of knowledge is a scientific picture of the world, which is a qualitative generalization and philosophical synthesis of various scientific theories. For mathematical knowledge such a complete system of representations is a mathematical picture of the world. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there is no single point of view on the subject of mathematics, the positions of scientists differ greatly in the ratio of the various components of mathematical knowledge, in particular between discrete and continuous models in mathematics. The purpose of the article is to consider the way of forming an integral mathematical picture of the world. The historical analysis carried out in the article shows that in the history of mathematics there were repeated attempts to disrupt the balance between discrete and continuous models, attempts to reduce mathematics to one of these two types of models. However, in this case it became obvious the destruction of the integrity of the mathematical picture of the world, the need for a new, balanced perspective on the nature of mathematics. This need became especially acute in recent decades due to the growing role and place of discrete sections of mathematics in the context of computerization of society. To solve the problem, the article uses the trinitarian methodology and historical analysis. This methodology is more and more widely used in post-nonclassical outlook recently though sprouts of this thinking arose for a long time. This methodology presupposes the existence of a third element in addition to two binary oppositions, which is necessary for solving the problem of binary contradictions, as a measure of their compromise, as an arbitrator, as a condition for their existence. On the basis of the trinitarian methodology, the article shows that the unity of discrete and continuous models can be provided by the third component - fractal models. Fractality is just as fundamental a structural property of matter as discreteness and continuity. Thus, fractal geometry is not just a new branch of mathematics, it is one of the most important components of the mathematical picture of the world. Thus, with the help of this new scientific direction, it is possible to ensure the unity of discreteness and continuity, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world among the students. Fractality is the fundamental structural property of matter, it is possible to ensure the synergy of discrete and continuous models, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world. The study of fractal geometry helps to increase the motivation to study mathematics, the convergence of learning and research, enhance the aesthetic appeal of mathematics.},

  abstract={Most model based methodologies for engineering or policy design depend upon possession of a model that is predictively accurate. However, many systems of practical importance are now recognized as being both highly complex and composed of multiple interacting adaptive agents. For these systems, the construction of a model that accurately predicts the details of system behavior is essentially impossible, and any model for these systems is certain to be "wrong" in at least some details. If modeling and simulation is to be used to reason from what is known about such systems, we must understand how to think usefully with "wrong" models. This paper describes an approach based on exploratory modeling and adaptive strategies that can be used to make decisions about systems that are so complex their detailed behavior cannot be predicted. This approach seeks to find strategies that perform reasonably well over broad ranges of plausible futures-instead of devising strategies that are optimal for some particular best estimate model.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the innovative application of physical laws, specifically Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, as metaphors within the realm of creative computing. By adapting gravitational concepts to measure the semantic “distances” and “attractions” between entities in textual data, we propose a computational model that interprets these relationships through the lens of physical force dynamics. This approach allows us to creatively visualise complex data interactions in a 3D space, where the metaphorical ‘mass’ and ‘distance’ between entities dictate their spatial arrangement based on calculated ‘gravitational’ forces. The core of our methodology involves the adaptation of the gravitational formula. We apply this model to a case study that demonstrates how entities with stronger semantic links are visually closer, creating imaginative and interpretative 3D scenes. This paper not only highlights the utility of physical metaphors in enhancing computational creativity but also opens new avenues for the application of such models in digital media, interactive art, and educational technologies. Further, this methodology can be extended to visualise and interpret health data, providing a novel representation of chronic conditions. By bridging physical theories and computational aesthetics, we provide a fresh perspective on data visualisation and creative computing.},

  abstract={Argumentation has been investigated mainly as an abstract formalism. However, when applying argumentation techniques in practice, abstract arguments need to be instantiated through a logic language into structured argumentation frameworks. Although structured argumentation frameworks provide practical use of argumentation, we think that computational arguments could give light to richer structures. In this work, we introduce a new category of computational arguments named M-arguments. M-arguments are not meta-arguments as the name could suggest, they are computational arguments with rich structure. Such a rich structure allows us to represent a large number of computational models of arguments. Further, M-arguments allows us not only to represent the usual structure of arguments, but also to represent relevant information that concerns the dialectic and rhetoric aspects of argumentation.},

  abstract={Artificial chemistries are mainly used to construct virtual systems that are expected to show behavior similar to living systems. In this study, we explore possibilities of applying an artificial chemistry to modeling natural biochemical systems—or, to be specific, molecular computing systems—and show that it may be a useful modeling tool for molecular computation. We previously proposed an artificial chemistry based on string pattern matching and recombination. This article first demonstrates that this artificial chemistry is computationally universal if it has only rules that have one reactant or two reactants. We think this is a good property of an artificial chemistry that models molecular computing, because natural elementary chemical reactions, on which molecular computing is based, are mostly unimolecular or bimolecular. Then we give two illustrative example models for DNA computing in our artificial chemistry: one is for the type of computation called the Adleman-Lipton paradigm, and the other is for a DNA implementation of a finite automaton. Through the construction of these models we observe preferred properties of the artificial chemistry for modeling molecular computing, such as having no spatial structure and being flexible in choosing levels of abstraction.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter deals with ways of evaluating the coupling that exists between disparate antennas that find themselves installed in each other's vicinity on vehicular platforms or indeed any platform. Clarity on a number of subtle ideas from electromagnetic theory greatly facilitates the understanding of the co&#x2010;sited antenna coupling problem. Study of the coupling between platform&#x2010;mounted antennas is in principle the same as studying coupling between the elements in an array antenna. The chapter describes antenna operation, and inter&#x2010;antenna coupling, in the way a full&#x2010;wave computational electromagnetics (CEM) model &#x201c;thinks&#x201d; about it. The rigorous formulations on which full&#x2010;wave CEM models are based argue as follows: the field generated by the impressed sources if all of the antenna structure were to be removed is the incident field and exists in all of space. Separate CEM models are in effect used to set up each of reduced complexity models for the antennas.</p>},

  abstract={Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract={Intelligent recommendation plays an important role in the field of intelligent education, among which arithmetic problem recommendation is an important research field. Geometry arithmetic problems are a major category of arithmetic problems which play a crucial role in nurturing students’ spatial perception, logical thinking, and computational skills. This paper proposes a scene-enhanced BERT model for recommending geometry arithmetic problems. Firstly, a multi-layer classification task of geometric knowledge was constructed for fine-tuning the BERT model. Secondly, this BERT model is used to vectorize the problem to be queried and the problem text in the database. Finally, the query questions are matched with questions under the same knowledge points using vector similarity calculations with diversity correction and recommended according to the score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved good efficiency and accuracy in recommending geometric arithmetic problems. Overall, this research offers an effective recommendation approach for the geometry arithmetic problem task, providing valuable insights for intelligent education field and tutoring system.},

  abstract={Explicit methods for the solution of fluid flow problems are of considerable interest in supercomputing. These methods parallelize well. The treatment of the boundaries is of particular interest both with respect to the numeric behavior of the solution, and the computational efficiency. We have solved the three-dimensional Euler equations for a twisted channel using second-order, centered difference operators, and a three stage Runge-Kutta method for the integration. Three different fourth-order dissipation operators were studied for numeric stabilization: one positive definite, [8], one positive semidefinite, [3], and one indefinite. The operators only differ in the treatment of the boundary. For computational efficiency all dissipation operators were designed with a constant bandwidth in matrix representation, with the bandwidth determined by the operator in the interior. The positive definite dissipation operator results in a significant growth in entropy close to the channel walls. The other operators maintain constant entropy. Several different implementations of the semidefinite operator obtained through factoring of the operator were also studied. We show the difference both in convergence rate and robustness for the different dissipation operators, and the factorizations of the operator due to Eriksson. For the simulations in this study one of the factorizations of the semidefinite operator required 70 - 90% of the number of iterations required by the positive definite operator. The indefinite operator was sensitive to perturbations in the inflow boundary conditions. The simulations were performed on a 8,192 processor Connection Machine system model CM-2. Full processor utilization was achieved, and a performance of 135 Mflops/s in single precision was obtained. A performance of 1.1 Gflops/s for a fully configured system with 65,536 processors was demonstrated.},

Sensor network works in very resource constraint environment. Due to these security reasons, we present various protocols to provide the basic needs of data security that are: confidentiality, authentication, freshness and authenticated broadcasting because this broadcasting requires some techniques or protocols to securely communicate with other sensor node(s).

  title={Lower bounds on information transfer in distributed computations}, 
  year={1978},
  volume={},

  pages={151-158},
  abstract={We derive a lower bound on the interprocessor information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network configuration. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communication. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations. Traditional measures of computational complexity, such as the number of primitive operations or memory cells required to compute functions, do not form an adequate framework for assessing the complexity of computations carried out in distributed networks. Even in the relatively straightforward situation of memoryless processors arranged in highly structured configurations, Gentleman [4] has demonstrated that data movement, rather than arithmetic operations, can often be the significant factor in the performance of parallel computations. And for the more general kinds of distributed processing, involving arbitrary network configurations and distributed data bases, the situation is correspondingly more complex. This paper addresses the problem of measuring computational complexity in terms of the interprocess communication required when a computation is distributed among a number of processors. More precisely, we model the distributed computation of functions which depend upon large amounts of data by assuming that the data is partitioned into disjoint subsets, and that a processor is assigned to each subset. Each processor (which we can think of as a node in a computational network) computes some values based on its own "local" data, and transmits these values to other processors, which are able to use them in subsequent local comutations. This "compute locally and share information" procedure is repeated over and over until finally some (predetermined) processor outputs the value of the desired function. In measuring the complexity of such computations we will be concerned, not with the individual local computations, but rather with the total information transfer, i.e., the total number of values which must be transmitted between processors. We derive a lower bound on the total information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communicaion. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations.},

  abstract={Decision makers (DMs) have different cognitive levels in practical experience, information reserve, and thinking ability. Thus, decision information is often not completely reliable. As a tool that can effectively represent information reliability, Z-number has been studied by many scholars in recent years. Current research on Z-number assumes that differences in various parts of a Z-number can complement one another. However, in many cases, the preference of DMs for each part is difficult to determine, or DMs believe that the differences in various parts cannot be complementary. Therefore, to solve such decision problems, this paper attempts to extend the traditional MABAC method to the Z-information environment by introducing the directed distance and regret theory. The proposed method simultaneously considers the randomness and fuzziness of Z-number. An example about regional circular economy development program selection is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can solve complex decision problems rationally and effectively, and it has broad application prospects.},

Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The already achieved results are exemplified via simulation, and the possible directions of the future research are briefly outlined, too.},

  abstract={In higher education enormous datasets exist about learners, their learning and the background in which they study. The educational knowledge of the learner's is improved, making use of different approaches. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the problems faced by the learner with the traditional teaching method and to enhance the teaching method and learning environment that improve the resulting ratio for providing healthier employment to the learner. The proposed work uses a novel teaching, observing the cognitive skills of the learner by changing the classroom environment. The learner's learning is improved with a positive approach in teaching, enriching the thinking ability and creating a stress-free environment as learning should be made an enjoyable moment. A real-time dataset is formed with the teaching and learning environment and analysis of the dataset is made to the Naive Bayes algorithm. Different metrics are evaluated to show the increased performance of the learner's with a positive approach in the learning environment.},

  abstract={The observed growth trend of the wireless communications market will drive the development of new wireless systems, including equalizers. Linear equalization is still a relatively low computational demand and easy-to- implement solution that may increase reliability in low data rate devices such as the ones required for IoT systems and wireless sensor networks. However, the relationship between the mean squared error (MSE) and the matrix correlation of the Least Squares (LS) estimation procedure, with the bit error rate (BER) of the system, has not been fully investigated. This paper presents a description of the simulated BER behavior, caused by the influence of the matrix correlation and MSE, through a causal analysis derived from a systems thinking approach. Then, it is proposed a descriptive hypothesis of the main cause and effect relationships involved in the generation of the BER behavior, using different training sequences in the LS optimization procedure.},

  abstract={Critical thinking and problem solving are fundamental skills to function successfully particularly in today's world. When programming, these skills are promoted, developed and deployed. In this context, Universidad ORT Uruguay and The University of Edinburgh co-created in 2015 a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that teaches young teenagers how to program. The course was implemented simultaneously in 2 versions: in Spanish, called “¡A Programar!” and in English, called “Code Yourself!”, which are available on the Coursera platform. Since its launch in March 2015, more than 139,000 people from 197 countries have registered. Initially it was offered in a “fixed session”; while currently it is offered in an “auto-cohort” mode. In both cases, students' surveys indicate that the course has met or exceeded expectations (values above 93%). In this paper, we detail the characteristics of the MOOC, and we analyze and compare the modes and results.},

  abstract={The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.},

  abstract={This research tries to construct a new architecture of intelligent information processing imitating that of human thought and having ability of autonomous learning. Its processing is divided into logical and intuitive processing, which are selected flexibly and properly for the changing situation. To investigate its effectiveness, it is applied to a robot playing a Tetris game, which is regarded as a symbol of human intellectual behavior. The robot consists of three elements: recognition part, thinking part, and action part. The thinking part consists of logical and intuitive processing. Logical processing has the ability of accurate and slow processing, and intuitive processing has the ability of rough and quick processing. The learning method of logical processing consists of fuzzy Q-learning with neural network and intuitive processing consists of neural network, which is trained by empirical knowledge of logical processing. The combination of logical and intuitive processing leads to the improvement of game playing results for the reason that intuitive and logical processing built along with playing time becomes more applicable. As a result, it is shown that the proposed method is a useful approach.},
