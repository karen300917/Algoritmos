  abstract={Social relationship is explained under the fuzzy set and fuzzy logic theory. A model for describing the individual nature of mind in the fuzzy environment is presented first, then extended for groups, couples, and social relationship dealing with both perfect and approximate reasoning. The fuzzy social relationship as proposed here also devise that goals of one individual may be seen as constraints upon others, and vice-versa. In this sense, the proposed fuzzy social relationship description is a special case of fuzzy decision-making in fuzzy environment. Moreover, the social relationship is, actually, a simple case of logic mapping. According to the fuzzy social model, the common sense and the advantage of being flexible is emphasized mainly one is interested in a social relationship and in avoiding conflicts. The proposed approach addresses not only human beings, yet it can be extended to describe a sociological perspective of relationship, as well as to overall relationship between societies, nations by including trading and diplomacy.},

  abstract={Hepatitis C virus is a massive health issue affecting significant portions of the world's population. Applying data preprocessing, feature reduction techniques, and generating rules based on the selected features for classification tasks are considered as important steps in the knowledge discovery in databases. This paper highlights a Rough-Granular Neural Networks model that incorporates Rough Sets and Artificial Neural Networks to make efficient data analysis and suggestive predictions. The Rough Sets is used as a powerful analysis tool for data pre-processing. It is used to reduce and choose the most relevant attributes for reducing the number of input vector to Artificial Neural Networks without reducing the basic knowledge of the information system. This is done to increase Classification accuracy of the proposed model. Resulting optimal data set is input to constructed neural network with supervised learning algorithm for classifying studied cases for testing new medication for HCV treatment. The experimental results show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the proposed model is a superlative result.},

At the same time, dynamic disturbances in production sites such as machine failures, reworking caused by quality problems, and changes of processing time and personnel will also have negative impacts on the effectiveness of the original plan. In order to ensure the feasibility of scheduling algorithms in highly dynamic environment, this paper presents agent-based rescheduling negotiation mechanisms with five dynamic disturbances, and verifies its feasibility through simulations. A multi-agent system structure with quick responses and simple communication networks is designed according to characteristics of hybrid flow shops, with which the processing of jobs can be easily traced back.},

  abstract={Courses to train modeling competence are held in higher educational institutions. These courses focus on the final artifacts submitted by learners for analysis and/or evaluation and do not clarify the intermediate creation process. This study focuses on quality of the final class diagram submitted by learners and trials and errors during the creation process. We tried to verify a hypothesis that learners to create an artifact with good quality make a number of trials and errors during the editing process. We collected the fine-grained data regarding the editing history of class diagrams created by learners by our tool called KIfU. We verified the hypothesis by analyzing the collected data. First, we defined two metrics ("Number of editing" and "Number of movement" of symbols in the artifact) calculated from the data that show the learners' trials and errors. Second, we divided learners into two groups, group that created artifacts with good quality and that with not good quality. Finally, we compared the metrics between the groups. The results show that there are statistically significantly differences of values of both metrics between the groups. We conclude the hypothesis we set is correct from the result.},

But it seems very hard to analyze the sentiment hided in Chinese Micro text because of its complexity. This paper proposes a new way to determine the sentiment tendency of Chinese micro text based on the partitioned Sense Group (STDSG). When to judge the sentiment tendency of Micro text, we first partition it into separate sense group, and then determine it's sentiment tendency based on Emotional Dictionary. And We aslo consider various factors which contain negations, degree adverbs and punctuations. The effectiveness of STDSG is strongly supported by the results of our experiments.},

  abstract={Ontology is the basis component of the Semantic Web. Since constructing ontologies is a time consuming job for domain experts, many researches are conducted on automatic extraction of ontologies from texts. As the development of folksonomy, more and more researchers have realized that folksonomy is a better knowledge source for constructing ontologies than texts. Although some works have already been proposed to extract ontologies from folksonomies, these works have little consideration on what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, and lack an principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human's perspective. According to the study in cognitive psychology, there is a family of concepts named basic level concepts, which are frequently used by people in daily life, and most human knowledge is expressed using basic level concepts. In this paper, inspired by studies in cognitive psychology, we try to extract ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on discovering basic level concepts in folksonomies and using them to construct ontologies.},

The sample size was 100(valid responses) being the management educator of Meerut city as a sample unit. Table & Descriptive Statistics were used to define the data and ‘Correlation and Multiple Regression Analysis’ were used for calculating the outcomes. Major respondents were young-aged educators that truly believe in a challenging and dynamic MEI as of now. The crisis management ability was the most crucial challenge of MEI. "Industry orientation" and "international perspective" were not significant challenges. The study was highly practical because "MEI" has been undergoing a roundabout transformation in the current digitalized scenario, and there has been a paradigm shift in overall higher education following COVID-19. It was highly important because budding managers and forthcoming business leaders have to perform in a highly dynamic environment, and the paper was original as 100 primary responses of management educators in Meerut City were taken into account for study.},

This paper presents some new teaching methods of Digital Image Processing in an application-oriented college. In classroom presentation, more vivid illustrations and less formula derivations are given. While in laboratory exercises, students are instructed to develop some basic image processing functions commonly used in daily digital lives. This acts as a main clue for the whole course: with the progress of classroom teaching, various image processing features are gradually added to the softwares developed by students themselves. Following these methods, students are stimulated and remarkable teaching results are achieved.},

However, despite the existence and benefits of this concept, China has weak green packaging legislation, a lack of relevant financial and technical expertise, a serious shortage of green packaging and other factors, that are hindering the full implementation of its green packaging strategy. To promote the development of green logistics and the implementation of the green packaging strategy, progress will have to be made both by the government and enterprises.

  abstract={Affective interaction with virtual humans can enhance the quality of user experience in virtual reality. It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.},

  abstract={Creativity becomes an ever important feature in software development nowadays as software application in various domains is on an ever rapid growth. It leads to changes on system requirements, hoping to improve systems with attractive creativity features. Consequently, creative computing is aroused as an emerging research field in software engineering. Currently, there are researches working on approaches and processes to develop creative software from scratch. However, evolving existing systems can achieve the same purpose, though it is hard to add creativity features to legacy systems by traditional software evolution approaches. Obviously, based on experiences over decades from software community, development from scratch might cause a waste in terms of resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Model Driven Architecture based reverse engineering method for creative evolution. Abstraction techniques are explored, classified, designed and applied in this proposed approach. Meanwhile, details and roles of abstraction techniques were developed for each step. Also, an e-learning system is chosen as a case study to illustrate, validate and evaluate the proposed method. Overall, our work aims to contribute to software evolution methodology and its application creatively.},

  abstract={Today’s technological developments are also having an impact on education. In higher education, there are more and more innovations in content and methodology, such as educational robots, which can be used not only for teaching programming, but also as teaching assistants and pedagogical assistants. Tutor robots offer new opportunities for curriculum development, motivating students, stimulating interest and developing soft skills, while preparing young people to use the latest technological tools. In our online survey, conducted in summer 2022, we explored the views of educators in 14 countries on the characteristics of robot-supported innovation in higher education. The results of the survey show that educators are open to educational innovations. Educational robots are mainly used for teaching programming. They believe that the use of social robots significantly improves students’ creativity and self-expression. The results of this research have shown that the use of educational social robots is an excellent opportunity for methodological innovation and provides scope for experimental teaching.},

  abstract={One of the most important reasons for poor performance on the basic education ICT projects is due to the lack of a systemic framework, which is used to identify the essential factors and their relationships during the project, the systemic framework is important especially for those cross-sector projects, such as the projects of ICT tests in Shanghai rural schools. Maturity Model frameworks were created and applied during the ICT test project, providing appropriate structures to deliver effective educational experiences in the use of ICT. Therefore, firstly the structures and details of these maturity models are depicted in this paper, secondly the results and the lessons that how these maturity models act in the projects are analyzed, and then a clue is given on how to find an appropriate way in the use of ICT projects in schools in China.},

  abstract={This paper introduces selected latest results of a research in situation based product definition. The current representative method of product definition applies situation based control of product feature parameters. In the presented method, application of situation control was improved by placing it from the product feature level to the product behavior level. Because the feature level situation control is a proven key technology in product lifecycle management systems, the new behavior level product definition process controls the process of the feature level product definition. This paper starts with a comparison of the feature and the behavior level product feature definition. Following this, the product request, product behavior, and context structure feature definitions are introduced as main elements of the behavior level product feature definition process. Next, a new context structure and its connection with the feature sequence is exampled and discussed. Finally, application of the proposed method in product lifecycle management systems is outlined.},

  abstract={The idea of brain machine interface (BMI) is to provide a source of interaction between a person and a machine via thought. Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in interest and challenges in image processing and pattern recognition, specifically in the context of air writing. This exciting research area has significant potential to advance automation processes and improve human-machine interfaces in various applications. The emergence of faster computers, affordable high-performance video cameras, and the need for automated analysis of videos has led to an increase in the popularity of object tracking, a critical task in computer vision. The process of video analysis typically encompasses object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis. Object tracking involves four main aspects choosing the suitable object representation, selecting features for tracking, detecting the object, and tracking the object. Object tracking algorithms find applications in different domains, including vehicle navigation, video indexing, and surveillance that are automated. The objective of the paper is to create a software application for smart wearable devices that utilizes computer vision to track finger gestures in the air, functioning as a motion-to-text converter for air-writing. The technology will facilitate communication for people by enabling them to generate text for multiple purposes, like sending emails and messages, through intermittent gestures. This is a productive means of communication that curbs the usage of laptops and mobiles, making it particularly beneficial for individuals who are deaf.},

  abstract={The advancement in technology related to artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot topic of debate in recent years. One concern is the possibility of job loss when machines with algorithms take over tasks that formerly required human labour. It analyses the implications of artificial intelligence technologies on the job market, paying particular attention to how it can decrease the demand for physical labour and perhaps oust employees from their professions. The distribution of wealth, salaries, efficiency, and job abilities are all areas where AI has the capability to have a significant impact. The paper also looks at the ethical implications of AI, such as how it will impact privacy, bias, and decision-making. The study outlines the potential dangers and benefits of AI on work and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders to lessen adverse effects and realize the potential benefits of AI through a thorough analysis of the available literature and case studies. The study concludes that AI can change how work is done and that proactive steps must be taken to solve potential problems and take full advantage of the opportunities that AI presents. Overall, the present study provides an in-depth knowledge of how AI will impact the workplace, placing a strong focus on the potential for job displacement and creation, the impact on salaries and output, and the need for ethical considerations.},

  abstract={In the course of creating and analyzing music content, artificial intelligence systems are widely used, and according to the forecasts of analysts, their use in the field of music will grow steadily. Modern artificial intelligence systems successfully solve problems that cause difficulties for humans. However, these systems lack the ability to create and evaluate the semantics of musical works the same way as humans do. The problem of creating musical artificial intelligence with the creative abilities of the human mind is one of the most topical and complex problems in the music industry. The solution to this problem in the first place lies in studying and understanding the essence of the term “Musical Sense”. The purpose of the study is to develop a concept for the probabilistic assessment of the musical texts' semantics based on the concepts of information theory and information technologies. To achieve the goal, a convergent approach to the study of the problem of musical meaning, proposed by Professor A. B. Kayak, was used. As a result of the completed study, the main conceptual provisions of the theory of probabilistic evaluation of musical senses have been developed. The article is of a theoretical nature. However, the materials of the article may be of practical interest for researchers of the problem of sense and developers of artificial intelligence in the music industry.},

  abstract={In this paper I presented an algorithm which could be used as a controller technique for access systems in highly-secured environments. Highly-secured environments like critical infrastructures have to count less significant but more effective risks, which may lead to a fatal effect in the society. More stringent regulations involve more reliable access systems, which use mostly multimodal biometrical identification. Soft-computing techniques, especially fuzzy logic is suitable as a controller algorithm in a multimodal biometrical identification system. To highlight the advantages of this method, I modeled a comparison between the statistical mean value calculation and the fuzzy logic adapted controller.},

Guided by the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) Model of Motivational Design and leveraging mobile microlearning (MML) principles, the IDRT integrates multimodal instructions and gamification features to encourage students to employ HCD. Implemented in a design-project-based class, 37 students' perceptions and engagement were evaluated using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. Results indicate positive feedback, high engagement levels, and increased comprehension of HCD. Analysis of design reports reveals a more diverse application of HCD, particularly among higher-performing students, indicating the IDRT's influence on intrinsic motivation. However, challenges were identified among lower-performing students, indicating the need for further research to enhance engagement. Overall, the study underscores the potential of MML as a viable instruction method to influence students' motivation and proficiency positively and to scaffold the T&L of HCD.},

  abstract={Permeability is a crucial factor in oil and gas exploration and development, as it indicates a reservoir's ability to flow. To predict permeability from electrical exploration results, Critical Path Analysis (CPA) is commonly used by combining reservoir permeability and electrical conductivity. However, the accuracy of CPA decreases when unconventional reservoirs exhibit strong anisotropy, such as fractured shales. This study presents tensor-based CPA methods that utilize equivalent electrical parameters and permeability tensor to address this issue. The approach involves obtaining critical pore radius and permeability in tensor form through matrix operation. The accuracy of the CPA formula in calculating reservoir permeability is then compared with numerical simulation results. The findings indicate that the tensor-based CPA method significantly improves the permeability prediction accuracy of anisotropic media, and further improvements can be made using the revised tensor-based CPA.},

  abstract={Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-end visual tasks that has remained a topic of interest in various domains. Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images. Finally, the problems and challenges to be tackled are concluded which highlight the future direction of analysis.},

  abstract={In this paper, the key and difficult problems in the teaching process of the course of Compilers Principles are studied, as well as the theory and practice teaching models are discussed. Then a Knowledge and Ability dual-driven Teaching Model for the course of Compilers Principles is proposed, that is to let students understand and master the compilers theory and technique through the course teaching; in addition, it takes compilation teaching as an approach to reveal and analyze the problem solving rules of "problem--formalized description -- computerization", and systematically trains and improves students' ability to use language and language processors to solve problems and even to solve complex engineering problems. We have tried and popularized this teaching model in the multiple rounds of teaching practices, and embodied this teaching idea in the study and development of the course standard for the course of Compilers Principles.},

  abstract={A lack of early exposure to computer science and a shortage of role models are known barriers hindering underrep-resented students' pursuit and success in the field. Consistent research indicates that students lacking early exposure tend to avoid college-level computer science courses and frequently underperform compared to peers with prior experience. In response, we've created a two-week computer science camp tailored for upper elementary and middle school students from rural and low-income backgrounds. The camp adapts computer science concepts to diverse cultures, challenges stereotypes, and showcases the diverse backgrounds of computer scientists. This paper outlines the camp's design, shares experiences from 40 participating students, and highlights engaging lessons that in-corporate technologies such as Sphero Bolt, Sphero Rover, Tello Drones, Lego Spike Prime, and Scratch. We also gather data on students' favorite activities to understand their interests. Our discussion covers effective strategies for participant recruitment, community trust-building, professional development facilitation, camp activity organization, and project promotion. By sharing challenges and lessons learned, we aim to assist fellow researchers and educators in similar initiatives, fostering collaboration and progress in the field of computer science education.},

  abstract={Experience is showing several problems with use cases such as lack of a precise definition that led some companies to develop their own version, lack of notion of atomicity, and considering only the user interface. If the analyst misinterpreted or neglected some structural or behavioral aspects, the resulting software system may not display the correct behavior or may ungracefully terminate. The use of events in the behavioral pattern analysis approach (BPA) provides cohesive integration between the static abstraction (classes) and the dynamic behavior. This integration may partially or totally eliminate the pre-mentioned problems. This paper presents the use of BPA to model a robot system in a manufacturing setting},

  abstract={social media in Education has worked like a revolution in changing the learning system. Learning according to the convenience such as place and time of the students has pulled more interest to educate more through social media. In this study, we had investigated the perspective of students from different educational levels towards social media learning. A total no. of 130 students participated in our online survey. Convenient sampling was used for the study. According to the results and findings of the study learning through social media has both positive and negative impacts. The majority of respondents spend 1–3 hours a day on average. Additionally, we found that Youtube is the most used application by students for social media learning among Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Whatsapp, and YouTube. Although learning through social media makes a great contribution for learners in their area of interest. However, it has also affected the physical and mental health of the students. Due to social media learning, socialization among people has been reduced.},

  abstract={In order to avoid the problem of mismatch between questioner and respondent, an impression evaluation experiment was conducted and nine factors were obtained as a result. The factors were then used to estimate the factor scores of all other statements through multiple regression analysis and to select the most appropriate respondents. The factors, however, have been obtained without taking into consideration the categories of the Q&A statements. In this paper we therefore investigated whether the consideration of categories could lead to obtaining more apparent tendencies and precise results to select the most appropriate respondents. In this paper, factor analysis is applied to the experimental results with a consideration of the following categories: Auction, PC, Love, and Politics. As a result of factor analysis, both similarity and difference could be observed for each category of Q&A statements. Comparing the new results with the previous one, two similar main factors could be obtained regardless of the category considered. On the other hand, factors other than the two have were also obtained for each respective category. This shows that the number of factors obtained for each category varies.},

In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.},

The bottom-up approach has been proved as more effective in process improvement applied to technical and scientific environments, in oppocition to standard improvement models such as ISO or CMMI. However, when bottom-up is applied to elicit improvement areas, the method is usually limited to the use of surveys that miss many of the root causes and structural deficiencies. To complement the elicitation process, we propose the use of requirement-gathering techniques such as Card Sorting, Kelly Grid and Multi-Voting. Initial results are discussed in this paper.},

  abstract={Global business environment in the modern times is being impacted by various forces such as advancement in technology, borderless trade, economic tremors and disruptions of business which have resulted in organizations adopting and using business excellence practices in order to achieve success in all domains of their business. There are several business excellence models available which are very famous amongst businesses, government and private accreditation agencies, regulators and policy makers. ISO has remained an all-time favorite quality standard for businesses. In the journey of excellence, most of the companies start with getting them in line with ISO standards and get certification. EFQM has also become very popular amongst modern day businesses as it sets more comprehensive view of business excellence and quality assurance. The aim of this paper is to understand the significance of business excellence and its internationally recognized models such as EFQM and ISO which assist in improving business performance. The paper also intends to highlight the similarities and dissimilarities between the two models and their implementation. Also, this is an effort to compare the two models (ISO and EFQM) to see their relevance and impact in the area of quality assurance and business excellence.},

  abstract={Teknologi Quran International is a startup company that runs on the education of Islam religion especially in Al-Qur’an recitation. Since this company was founded in 2015, there has been no significant profit from applications that can sponsor the operational cost of the company. This then led to the unfocused development of the Learn Quran Tajwid application because most of the employees now have other external projects outside the company. Therefore, the evaluation of the business model is provided to suggest the monetization model so that the company can gain more profit on its side. The challenged-based learning (CBL) methodology is conducted through qualitative data collection with contextual interviews in order to assess the learning theory which has been implemented and finding the perfect in-app purchasing as well as an organic marketing technique that wants to be implemented in the future. The application that is examined by 20 most convenient user samples and stakeholder’s recommended domain or subject expert, is available on both platforms, Android, and iOS. The evaluation results show that the monetization model of Learn Quran Tajwid needs to be improved completely since right now there are so many possibilities from the active users who have an opportunity to be taken advantage of by the company. This research can also give benefits to a startup company that wants to have a combination of more sustainable monetization models.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={51-55},
  abstract={The article refers to interdisciplinary scientific research in philosophy, information theory and the theory of algorithms. This article presents the results of theoretical studies on the formalization of human intellectual activity in relation to the field of cognitive sciences. The subject of the study is the concept of sense. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.},

  abstract={It is necessary to develop students to become lifelong learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to meet the challenges in the 21st century. Therefore, the STEM research center of Universitas Syiah Kuala in collaboration with other stakeholders in education, namely government, industry, public, and media has launched the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Character (STEMC) learning approach. There are six aspects to be developed through the STEMC approach: critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, computational thinking, and characters. In general, the nature of STEMC is not only a process of transferring knowledge from teachers to students but also an effort to build students' character. STEMC approach is designed to improve students' scientific abilities, motivation, and perseverance. It means that every phase of learning is designing to support students' intellectual and emotional growth. This paper aims to address what has been done at the STEM Research Center of Universitas Syiah Kuala and the plan for integrating STEMC in Indonesia. It provides an overview of some projects that have been conducted, such as the development of STEMC modules for senior high schools and collaboration with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in teacher professional development programs.

  abstract={This paper explores the intersection of historical exploration, gamification, and immersive technologies to enhance engagement and learning in history education. Traditional methods of historical inquiry often struggle to captivate learners' interest, particularly in an era dominated by digital experiences. Gamification, incorporating game elements into non-game contexts, has shown promise in fostering engagement and motivation. This study delves into the potential benefits of leveraging immersive gamification to create dynamic and captivating historical exploration experiences. The theoretical framework draws upon educational theories, game design principles, and the evolving landscape of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. We examine the limitations of traditional historical education methods and discuss how gamification can address these challenges by providing interactive and participatory learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper outlines fundamental design principles for creating immersive historical exploration scenarios, emphasising the importance of narrative structure, game mechanics, and user engagement. Through case studies, we highlight successful applications of immersive gamification in historical education, presenting outcomes and insights gained from these implementations. Challenges and considerations in integrating immersive gamification into historical exploration are also explored, including ethical considerations and accessibility issues. The paper concludes by proposing future directions for research in this emerging field, anticipating the continued evolution of technologies and pedagogical approaches.},

  abstract={Perhaps the easiest way to present the central theme of this article is to ask the following thought question: "how many people would it take to destroy the world?" By "world" in this context, I am referring to humankind. Destroying the world has been a recurring theme in novels and movies for many years. The end of the world is also an element of many religions. However, until this century there was no real belief that mankind could destroy itself. So, for most of human pre-history and history, destruction of the human race would only have been remotely possible through mass murder/suicide. This was hardly a likely prospect. In the 1800's mechanized warfare and massive production and transport of weapons and supplies became possible. This increased the destructive potential of war, but still did not make it a likely mechanism for global self-destruction. It was only in the 1940s and 1950s that we have achieved the means to destroy the world, with the development and massive production of nuclear weapons. However, developing this capability required a very large technological effort, which only resided in the hands of the large governments. Tens of thousands of people, supported by economies of tens of millions, were required to produce this capability.},

  abstract={In the ever-evolving field of technologies, the emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI), often referred as strong artificial intelligence (AI), stands as a breakthrough in the realm of machine intelligence, promising to witness a new era of capabilities and possibilities. In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.},

  year={2022},

  pages={289-309},
  abstract={What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.},

  abstract={Several reasons have led to the widespread adoption of neural-based algorithms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), including their high performance, elegant model designs, and parallel computing capabilities. Numerous ASR models have been proposed to improve the recognition results, but the gains are still insufficient. This paper proposes a re-thinking ASR model, which aims to bridge the gap by rethinking the regularities of a given hypothesis and the relationship between text-level and acoustic-level characteristics of the input speech utterance. For the re-thinking ASR model, a mixed attention mechanism, a self-and-mixed attention mechanism, and a deep acoustic feature extractor are meticulously designed to enable the notion to be realized. A publicly available benchmark corpus is used to evaluate the proposed model. As the experimental results demonstrate, the proposed re-thinking ASR model can provide significant and consistent improvements over popular baseline systems.},

  abstract={As one of the most striking research hotspots in both academia and industry, Internet of Things (IoT) has been constantly changing our daily life by joining together nearly all we can imagine. From home furnishings and vehicles to urban facilities, all these smart things need powerful managing and processing capabilities to deal with mass multimedia data in different content forms such as images, audios, and videos. Nowadays, since Moore's Law is no longer applicable, conventional thinking may not be adequate in facing the explosive growing amount of data. Hence, in this paper, we adopt the idea of in-memory processing to solve the problem of real-time multimedia big data computing in IoT. We apply closed-loop feedback in the scheduling method design to integrate in-memory storages of all devices within a 3-tier network structure. In addition, we consider the respective conditions of different real-time required levels and content forms. The analysis results show that our scheduling method can achieve better workload allocation with less latency in comparison of existing methods.},

  abstract={Women are underrepresented in the field of Computer Science. This project aims to help Secondary School girls develop an insight into the role computers play in society and to learn some of the key skills in computing including computer programming. Exposure to Computer Science, in home or school environments, and encouragement from family and peers are leading factors that influence girls' decisions to pursue careers in Computer Science. Other factors include the girls' perception of their own problem solving ability, an understanding of the diverse applications of Computer Science and related career paths and the potential for positive social impact. This paper describes the design of an after school computing programme, CodePlus, which uses a novel 21st Century learning model. Pre and post questionnaire are being used to explore girls intentions to study CS, their confidence to study CS, perception of CS as a career, gender perception of CS and IT profession and self-efficacy following participation in the CodePlus programme. Preliminary results comparing pre questionnaire results with a male control group highlight differences in how girls see themselves in terms of CS capabilities and their future potential. Initial post questionnaire findings show a significant increase in the participants' perceived programming ability.},

  abstract={The impact of technology on workforce development and socioeconomic prosperity has made K-12 computing engineering and STEM in general a national educational priority. However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.},

  abstract={As part of the 3D printing summer course for undergrads in our university, students were introduced to Autodesk Tinkercad as a design tool for creating and editing 3D models. After a brief period of familiarization with Tinkercad, we presented students with Codeblocks, a tool integrated with Tinkercad that enables the creation of 3D models through programming under the blocks model. To our surprise, students started creating complex and lengthy programs to produce original printable 3D objects. We decided to investigate this level of engagement using a questionnaire to collect opinions and experiences from students and a set of metrics to categorize their programming work. The results obtained are presented in this paper along with our conjectures on the causes of the enthusiasm observed with Codeblocks. Three factors seem to have been key in this case: diversity in the composition of the student group, availability of 3D printers to materialize designs, and a relaxed environment where test and failure were common and acceptable.},

  abstract={It is widely acknowledged that many freshmen go to university without any prior grounding in computer science. Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications. The paper outlines the course and its content in detail, as well as providing quantitative and qualitative evidence of its benefit and appeal to female students.},

Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills.},

We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.},

  abstract={Until relatively recently, technology has been used as a passive tool that makes the learner a user of various applications. However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out. The results obtained indicate that they have been able to master the new vocabulary, assimilate the concepts and work for themselves with the chosen tool to carry out the intervention.},

  abstract={The global video game industry's revenues reached 7.2 billion in 2007 and over $65 billion in 2012 with projected growth over $80 billion by 2017. As new consoles, PC, and mobile devices penetrate more foreign markets, revenues derived from these devices and software will continue to increase. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design. This degree will give students the skills needed to pursue a career within the game industry and others while developing engineering skills.},

  abstract={Problems involving human activity systems contain a soft element which makes them hard to resolve using traditional approaches. Teaching programming is no difference in this regard. The presence of numerous factors makes it a complex and messy situation. However, one key contributor to this problem is the differences in perception of the parties involved. This paper aims to analyze the problem of teaching programming within a computer science department at Omar Elmukhtar University (OMU) through the application of soft system methodology SSM, in addition to investigating the effects and benefits of using such an approach in order to suggest a solution. Through constructing a root definition and conceptual model, we were able to provide a standard to which the current organization can be compared against, and therefore, achieve a better understanding regarding which changes need to be carried out in order to attain the system's desired results.},

On one hand, it presents the technical aspects of the environment and, on the other hand, based on an experimental study done, it identifies students' behavior and attitudes when playing on their own initiative. We want to verify the relations between students' performance and their engagement, satisfaction, and problem-solving strategies. The understanding of these relations may help to identify students' characteristics that may point out to the teacher the need for individualized support.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This practice work-in-progress paper describes an innovative laboratory course designed to introduce a heterogenous cohort of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering and science to the principles of designing and analyzing complex electronic systems. The course utilizes a self-developed drum machine as a visual and acoustic project with a gradually increasing level of complexity throughout the lab sessions. Through active participation students acquire an understanding of SPICE simulations, test & measurement equipment, and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The course is mandatory for students pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical, mechatronic, biomedical, computational, and information system engineering, and is also attended as an optional module by computer science and physics students. In the winter term of 2022, the course returned to the lab after the COVID-19 pandemic and was attended by more than 200 students. The laboratory experiments are supported by complementary activities, such as SPICE simulations of the circuits as preparation, and lab reports written in LaTeX to introduce the students to scientific writing. Instructional videos and consultation hours are offered to assist with SPICE simulation and LaTeX. During the physical lab sessions, students work in groups of three in a traditional laboratory environment, with student tutors available to provide guidance offered in the form of minimal help. Overall, the presented lab course is an innovative and engaging method of teaching electronic systems. The self-developed drum machine provides a visually and audibly stimulating project, allowing students to learn practical skills and develop their theoretical knowledge.},

This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong.},

As a comparison study, participants played an existing desktop-based game (LightBot) and the developed VR game (LogiBot) covering similar gameplay mechanics and block-based programming. Initial results indicate that traditional desktop applications are currently more engaging than VR for teaching programming. We thus identify the need for careful design of interaction methods to support ease of use and reward factors to promote engagement in VR-based learning applications beyond the initial wow-factor.},

  abstract={Mobile programming is one of the fastest growing approaches in many fields, such as marketing or e-commerce. From the educational perspective, this means that students should understand that they can build mobile applications (apps) without being professionals, and at the same time recognize their own potential to use technology in any professional path they choose. This goal is not trivial, even if students are in general curious and open to learn about the creation of apps. Indeed, especially in liberal education, students get discouraged upfront as they perceive programming as a difficult task. This paper describes a course that was cre- ated to fit the educational needs of a social-economic high school. Students take part of an interdisciplinary project in which the Software Engineering process is used to promote CT skills. The course was repeated twice and involved 29 students (8th and 9th grade).},
