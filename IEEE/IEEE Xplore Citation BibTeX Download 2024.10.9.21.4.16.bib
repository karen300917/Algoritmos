  abstract={In Norway, a health reform was recently adopted to improve continuity of care. Services that were carried out in hospitals were transferred to municipalities. Small and medium size municipalities have established inter-municipal cooperation to provide specialized services across borders. The research project eHealth-extended Care Coordination studied the inter-municipal cooperation for assessment of dementia, identifying a need for improved communication and coordination. This paper presents the development process of a collaborative information system for dementia assessment using a user-centered design approach. Mixed methods, such as observations, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire, were used for data collection. The results showed that end-user involvement usefully informed the development. The information system effectively supported collaborative work and shared access to information for the inter-municipal team.},

  year={2021},
  volume={18},

  pages={250-260},
  abstract={Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$f∘g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even “well-mixedness”, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.},

  abstract={Industry placements have been lauded as providing benefits to students, industry and academia. While semester-long placements that require a break from study are reported as the most effective, not all students want to extend their course. Short-term placements can also have positive outcomes for student employability, industry skilled-worker supply and enhancement of curriculum. Assessment of student performance though is challenging, as their focus during the placement needs to be on completing tasks for a sponsor. This paper is a case study of a successful short-term placement program used to identify the important factors and components of an assessment scheme for a short-term placement.},

  abstract={Increasing use of heuristic algorithms in various fields of science causes numerous modifications of the original algorithms in need for better performance and efficiency. The main problem of heuristics is time required to find optimal solution. For this purpose, we propose to use parallel processing in the initial phase of heuristic methods to decrease computing time. Implemented technique models migration of individuals by adjusting initial population to required conditions. Proposed approach is simulating parallel processes that take place in human brain while solving tasks. In this case, human intelligence is working parallel on various aspects of the problem to compare them in the end before final decision. Proposed approach is simulating this parallelization of thinking threads in the process of optimization.

  pages={663-668},
  abstract={The Hierarchical Inheritance Algorithm (HGA) is an optimization technique inspired by biological principles of natural selection and heredity. This approach is versatile, finding applications in fields such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning, adaptive control, and more. It stands as a cornerstone in the realm of intelligent computing. This study bridges the gap between information technology and progressive management methodologies, aiming to adapt outdated financial management strategies to the demands of a digitalized environment, thereby pioneering a centralized financial management paradigm in the digital realm. The focus of this paper is to explore this digitally-centered financial management framework and propose a design tailored to the online ecosystem. Our findings indicate that the concept of smart finance goes beyond a mere blend of "AI and finance." Implementing its technologies involves a unique methodology that thrives on "closed-loop thinking." By gleaning insights from AI applications in diverse sectors, we've outlined the foundational pillars of smart finance application: digital transformation of specialized financial operations, algorithms rooted in financial logic that are fine-tuned through iterations, the fusion of data analytics within financial operations leading to product-centric solutions, and achieving a significant 90.00% platform integration for these smart financial solutions. As artificial intelligence technology continues to evolve, financial management will undoubtedly gravitate towards being instantaneous, user-centric, and intelligent. This will usher in heightened efficiency and benefits, heralding a new age in financial management.},

  volume={8},
  number={4},
  pages={39-51},
  abstract={In recent years, satellite formation flying has become an increasingly hot topic for both the astronomy and earth science communities due to its potential merits compared with a single monolithic spacecraft system. This paper proposes a novel approach based on closed-loop brain storm optimization (CLBSO) algorithms to address the optimal formation reconfiguration of multiple satellites using two-impulse control. The optimal satellite formation reconfiguration is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraints of overall fuel cost minimization, final configuration, and collision avoidance. Three versions of CLBSOs are developed by replacing the creating operator in basic brain storm optimization (BSO) with closed-loop strategies, which facilitate search characteristic capture and enhance the optimization performance by taking advantage of feedback information in the search process. Numerical simulations are carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), basic BSO, and the three versions of CLBSOs. Comparison results show that all versions of CLBSOs outperform PSO and the original BSO in terms of final results and convergence speed. In addition, CLBSO reduces the computation burden and shortens CPU time to a certain extent in contrast with basic BSO. Furthermore, among the three CLBSO algorithms, the one using the strategy of difference with the best gains the best overall performance, which is inspired by the updating rule in PSO that each particle tends to move towards the individual with the best fitness.},

Neural modeling fields and dynamic logic describe it mathematically and relate to language, concepts, emotions, and behavior. Perception and cognition, consciousness and unconsciousness, are described, while overcoming past mathematical difficulties of modeling intelligence. The two main aspects of the knowledge instinct determining evolution are differentiation and synthesis. Differentiation proceeds from and unconscious states to more crisp and conscious, from less knowledge to more knowledge; it separates concepts from emotions, Its main mechanism is language. Synthesis strives to achieve unity and meaning of knowledge; it is necessary for resolving contradictions, concentrating will and for purposeful actions. Synthesis connects language and cognition. Its main mechanisms are emotionality of languages and the hierarchy of the mind. Differentiation and synthesis are in complex relationship of symbiosis and opposition. This Leads to complex dynamics of evolution of consciousness and languages. Its mathematical modeling predicts evolution of cultures. We discuss existing evidence and future research directions.},

  abstract={Significant gap between software programming model and execution model is one major slowing factor in the development of the emerging field of Internet-of-Things. It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={110558-110572},
  abstract={Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

  volume={},

  pages={1187-1195},
  abstract={With the progress of science and technology, quantum computing plays an increasingly important role in various fields, solving the traditional arithmetic bottleneck. In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1585-1596},
  abstract={In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models’ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.},

  year={2024},
  volume={5},

  pages={380-392},
  abstract={Factor graph, as a bipartite graphical model, offers a structured representation by revealing local connections among graph nodes. This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.},

It's expected to provide conceptual and technological tools for supporting analysis and decision making in areas related to national and public security, political stability, law and order, and sociocultural changes. Modeling social and cultural processes must draw on the knowledge obtained within social sciences, including conceptual models, cultural insights, and empirical data. However, how to best integrate social scientific knowledge into modeling remains an open research problem. The author presents the perspective of a social scientist to describe why modeling can be useful for social research on political violence, social conflicts, and cultural changes. She develops an interactionist approach to interdisciplinary research practice and discusses how this approach can help identify the problems related to the integration of social scientific knowledge in modeling. The discussion focuses upon research on political violence and related sociocultural processes.},

As a network service, computing resources are made available. These services are cost-effective, scalable, and self-contained. Cloud computing is responsible for the IT industry's rapid growth. Despite its many benefits, it has a number of security concerns that must be addressed. In order to make Cloud Computing even more secure and trustworthy, some efforts must be made against the model's hazards. All of the risks linked with Cloud Computing, as well as potential cures, are evaluated in this paper. Various resources like as memory, software, CPU, and network services are offered on-demand via the internet in cloud computing. Because all resources such as hardware, software, and network are used without physically purchasing them, the company's primary investment in the cloud is retained. Many advances are being implemented in the cloud platform to deliver a better experience for cloud users.},

  abstract={Sound recognition refers to the technology or process of identifying and classifying different sounds or audio signals. This study aims to develop a sound recognition system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify and identify the gender of catfish based on their speech patterns. The study explores a range of supervised ML and DL algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, to predict the gender of catfish. The extracted features from the audio signals of the catfish serve as inputs to these algorithms, which produce binary predictions classifying the catfish samples as either male or female. This study further explores data analysis of the audio signals from the male and female catfish. The automated sound recognition system proves to be a more efficient and accurate approach compared to traditional methods, which rely on time-consuming visual observations. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, and more, were employed to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the gender of catfish based on speech patterns. Among the employed algorithms, ANN and NB demonstrate the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 89.47%.},

  abstract={Health care is the improvement of health through the avoidance and cure of diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.},

  abstract={Recent developments in computational freeform inverse design have provided a fertile landscape of structures and topologies for nanophotonics. However, simply dumping millions of parameters into a simulation can easily lead to intractable computational problems. Fortunately, a given engineering problem often admits many different mathematical formulations, and by carefully matching the formulation to the available electromagnetic solvers and optimization algorithms one can set the stage for extraordinarily flexible automated design. In this talk, we will show that, with careful consideration and reformulation of the design problem, powerful inverse design techniques can be successfully applied to a multitude of interesting problems with rich physical behavior, ranging from light confinement in nonlinear multi-resonant cavities, robust bandgap maximization in 3D photonic crystals to beam-forming and manipulation through multi-layered metasurfaces.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.},

  abstract={Many works have been done in an effort to create systems for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes. Although most of them are related to the recipe ingredient lists, few works have been done to evaluate and generate the preparation steps of culinary recipes. This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={0707-0711},
  abstract={The four quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement, tunneling, and annealing are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with classical computers. These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different “realities” in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power.},

  abstract={When we build systems to operate in hazardous or remote environments, and especially when we expect them to cooperate with others in support of a goal, we rely on them to operate as correctly as possible in the (unpredicted, frequently unpredictable) situations they encounter. But the environment does whatever it does; we have essentially no control and only limited knowledge of what it does, and only the most meager notion of what it will do. In this paper, we describe an architecture for these component systems that we think will be better suited to the vagaries of environmental behavior than others. We advocate a collection of subsidiary systems to operate in parallel with the main system, to act as “outriggers” for unexpected environmental behaviors or system failures, or as “training wheels” during development.. We describe our initial notions of how they relate to the original system and how to implement them.},

A primary objective of the CS10K and CS For All initiatives is the education of K-12 teachers in aspects of computer science and computational thinking so they can teach CS courses in their schools. Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings.},

  title={Adapting an OER Textbook for the Inverted Classroom Model — How To Flip the Classroom with BBC micro:bit Example Tasks}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.},

Although existing work has addressed a few factors, there is no work which provides a complete analysis of path loss incorporating such factors and how they affect on Received Signal Level. To get a clear picture of what work has been proposed in the literature, we present a survey article that gathers information about various propagation models used and proposed for maritime environment. We analyze each work based on the simulation set up, number of factors considered, error differences between simulated and experimental data and so on. We believe this article will help to identify the current state in simulation and analysis of communication links over the sea environment.},

The resources of the production plant are modelled in order to enable the simulation of their functionalities. A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities. Efficient algorithms and technologies for data analysis and prediction are utilized. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be predicted as a result from the simulation of physically-based models, without the machines' operation being stopped, as it happens in the common predictive maintenance solutions.},

  abstract={AI systems have seen significant adoption in various domains. At the same time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by the inability to fully trust an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides, fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability are vital to developing trust in AI systems. As stated in Describing Trustworthy AI,aa.https://www.ibm.com/watson/trustworthy-ai. “Trust comes through understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were included are crucial to understand.” The subarea of explaining AI systems has come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on “domain knowledge,” including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use. Contemporary XAI methods are yet addressed explanations that enable decision-making similar to an expert. Figure 1 shows the stages of adoption of an AI system into the real world.},

  abstract={Plagiarism is known as illegal use of others' part of work or whole work as one's own in any field such as art, poetry, literature, cinema, research and other creative forms of study. Plagiarism is one of the important issues in academic and research fields and giving more concern in academic systems. The situation is even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and minimize the plagiarism among students.},

  abstract={Emotions have been shown to have an important role on several human processes such as decision-making, planning, cognition, and, in particular, learning. However, many e-learning systems disregard the emotional aspects of the learning process and the impact of these aspects on the student's performance. The paper presents an intelligent agent with synthesized emotions that influence its beliefs, desires, and intentions in order to drive the agent behavior. Based on this model, we propose an artificial tutor, integrated in an e-learning system, which develops lectures plans and tailors its behavior towards the student according to the student reactions and his/her presumed affective states.},

  abstract={Model driven architecture (MDA) is a software development framework based on automatic transformations of models. The first of these models, the computation independent model (CIM), is used to define the business system, and it is usually represented with UML models. Natural language is widely used in requirements engineering as it is generally understandable by stakeholders encouraging their participation. Therefore, in order to enhance the first stages of MDA software development, we propose to define natural language oriented requirements models and derive from them a CIM. To achieve this integration we describe in this paper an automatic process to derive a business class diagram representing the structural aspects of a CIM starting from natural language oriented models.},

  abstract={A novel modeling method is presented for knowledge intensive representation of engineering objects in product model in order to establish product-wide coordinated decision making during lifecycle of product. The currently prevailing product model space is extended by entities representing human affect driven change attempt, product behavior, change affect zone, and contextual change chain. The purpose of this modeling is utilization of possibilities offered by integrated application of sophisticated product modeling and intelligent engineering in order to establish a contribution to find solution for an actual product model related problem in communication between engineers. This problem has been emerged by the new style of engineering where cooperating humans use product model as a medium. The extended model is called as virtual engineering space. Term engineering space refers to the emphasis on serving engineering processes in virtual space. In this paper, definition of key concepts and placing the research in related works are followed by characterization of current virtual product spaces and the related engineering methods. Main contribution of the paper explains a three sectored multilevel model of product and application of this concept at definition of virtual engineering space. Finally, a human intent based process for decision making on product object parameters is explained as an example for application of the proposed virtual engineering space.},

  abstract={Different people may have a different learning styles and it is important to provide the most suitable content and course materials for learning. However, determining the learning style may be difficult due to limited information about the learner and lack of a learner profile. The learner has to complete a questionnaire form based on educational theory in order to determine the learning style. Moreover, it is necessary to know the learner's study record related to other factors such as demographic factors. Therefore, an enhanced model to identify learning style is needed. This research aims to address the problem of identifying the learning style for a new student. A learning style classification model was proposed and ensemble classification techniques were implemented. The results showed that the proposed ensemble classification techniques performed better compared to other classification techniques used in the experiment.},

  abstract={Model Driven Engineering proposes the use of models as the main development artifacts. This methodology involves generating code from models and then perhaps adding some details to the generated code. Frequently, it is required to also reverse-engineer code to generate models. Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented programming platform. A functional layer of an airline reservation system is presented as a case study.},

  abstract={Now a day's, online reviews has become one of the most important part of any business. Posting reviews online for products bought or services received has become a trendy approach for people to express opinions and sentiments, which is essential for business intelligence, vendors and other interested parties. Social media like Twitter contains rich information about people's preferences. In this paper movie domain is considered for data mining. For dealing the problem of review mining for predicting sales performance, we have used massive collection of online reviews from IMDB along with thoughts of people about movies from Twitter; both are mined and processed by applying various algorithms. Our analysis shows that both Sentiments captured from reviews and tweets have a major impact on the future sales performance of the movie. For the sentiment factor, we have used Sentiment Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (S-PLSA) model it is a probabilistic approach to analyzing the sentiments in reviews and tweets, which provides succinct summary of the sentiment information. The summarization of both reviews and tweets in terms of sentiments along with additional input of the box office collection from IMDB is given to an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model (ARSA) for sales prediction. After that we have done sentiment analysis of online reviews. In sentiment analysis reviews are classified into negative and positive. We used a simple metric P-N ratio to predict the success of movies i.e. Hit, Average, Flop.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of internet access has given rise to a digital era. The availability of internet access has pushed almost 70% of the population to switch to internet for their daily needs and accessories. Mainly, E-commerce platforms are being used at a much higher rate than ever before. People who buy from these e-commerce platforms make decisions on whether to buy a product or not solely based on the ratings and reviews of a product that are provided by these platforms. Due to the simple nature of this review system, sellers and even individuals tend to exploit it by writing dishonest reviews with an intention of either boosting its ratings or simply to sabotage it. These fake reviews are aimed at deceiving customers and convince them to buy/deter a certain product. Due to the lack of a robust system to identify real and fake reviews, these spams manage to show up on top. To avoid this problem and provide a more efficient way to filter and provide a more efficient way to reviews. This work focus on designing machine learning model for fake review detection and compare the performance of three different algorithms. As a result of this research work random forest algorithm outperform than other two algorithms.

  abstract={Modeling and simulating a real world scenario is fundamentally an abstraction that takes only part of the given scenario into the model. Furthermore, the level of detail in the model, a.k.a. the resolution, plays an important role in the modeling and simulation process. Finally, the abstraction and resolution of the model determine the fidelity of the modeling and simulation, which becomes the ultimate utility for the model users. While abstraction, resolution and fidelity are the corner stones of the modeling and simulation discipline, they are often casually utilized. Moreover, their interplay is not investigated in-depth with explicit operationalization of the concepts. This article operationalizes the concept of abstraction, resolution, and fidelity by focusing on the aspect of model information. This theoretic investigation answers propositions involving these concepts, i.e. whether or not a higher resolution model has higher fidelity and why, through set theoretic approaches.},

When the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation is high, we directly downgrade roles of user to the lowest. Otherwise, we calculate the value of trust, and downgrade the roles of user according to the value of trust, finally activate downgrade roles. In addition, the model introduces downgrade roles, which stored downgrade roles of user. If downgrade roles are nonempty, we directly activate downgrade roles without re-judged, which improves the efficiency of the system.},

  abstract={The design of object-oriented systems starts with modeling, a process to identify core concepts and their relations. Mainstream modeling techniques can be either informal (white board, CRC cards, etc.) or formal (e.g., UML editors). The former support well the creative modeling process, but their output is difficult to store, process and maintain. The latter reduce these problems, at the expense of creativity and productivity because they are tedious and not trivial to use. We present Cel, a touch- and gesture-based iPad application to rapidly create, manipulate, and store language agnostic object-oriented software models, based on a minimal set of constructs.

  abstract={Quality Engineering Education has been identified as the foremost thrust area in India. The thrust is mainly due to the new establishment/enrichment of various core engineering industry sectors like Automobile, Healthcare, Agriculture, Avionics, Structural, Telecommunication and Mobile Technologies. Currently even though the country graduates a bulk volume of engineers every year, a major composition of this volume is drained to IT service sectors for employment. To enhance the above thrust of the country many engineering education institutions started focusing on quality of the offered education in terms of numerical ability, creativity and design ability of engineers. The Course Outcomes and Programme Specific Outcomes have been designed with the above focus as a guideline. More emphasis on integration of technology into instruction with learner-centric approach is encouraged. Simulation tools as teaching aids will enrich the understanding ability of the learner. In this work the confidence level of the learners to attain the course level objectives through simulation based teaching pedagogy has been explored. The survey records ensure the impact of this innovative instructional design for the desired course outcomes.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the services on the World Wide Web (WWW) are proliferating dramatically. The relationships of invoking among these services are becoming more and more complicated. The performances of traditional automated service composition methods suffer from the complexity of the service composition problem. Hence it is hardly to apply these automated methods in real cases. Semi-automated service composition is an alternative for coping with the complexity of service composition. A novel end-user oriented service composition model based on quotient space theory and service relation diagram is presented. This model proposes a hierarchical service composition from coarse-grain to fine-grain. The performance analysis and simulation showed that this model can reduce the complexity of service composition efficiently.},

  abstract={The importance of teaching a solid design methodology is well-recognized and is the goal of many software development courses. There is an ongoing debate concerning how to approach the learning and teaching of this skill, i.e., by focusing on “design first” by means of the UML formalism or by “OO programming first”, deferring the development of UML specifications. This work presents a teaching experience and curriculum content where a “design-first” approach was used to teach Object Oriented Design, incrementally interleaved with Object Oriented Programming aimed at implementing the modeled software through laboratory activities. Working in groups allowed the students to improve communication and collaboration skills, and the use of web 2.0 technologies, such as a wiki, allowed for better course management and for the deployment of a project involving all the students. This approach was used in two year-long courses with students who had slightly different backgrounds and dispositions. Also presented are a preliminary analysis of the written examinations and laboratory exercises; an analysis of common errors and student misconceptions and a preliminary quantitative measure of the results.},

  abstract={1 in 88 children is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Specific software, virtual worlds, and games may be used to improve social and language skills. These tools may be combined with the DIR/Floortime therapeutic model that encourages parents, teachers, and therapists to engage these children through their own (sometimes limited) interests. Applying this framework, this paper suggests the creation of a workshop modeled after the Computer Clubhouse, as developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which would take advantage of the children's sometimes above-average analytic and visual abilities. Participants would produce their own video games with Scratch or other age-appropriate tool. In this way, children on the autism spectrum could pursue their interests in computers and games while strengthening their creativity and problem-solving skills: areas that are sometimes difficult for those with the disorder.},

Research on automatic detection of naturalistic affective body expressions is still lagging behind detection based on other modalities whereas movement behaviour modelling is a very interesting and very relevant research problem for the affective computing community. The AffectMove challenge aimed to take advantage of existing body movement datasets to address key research problems of automatic recognition of naturalistic and complex affective behaviour from this type of data. Participating teams competed to solve at least one of three tasks based on datasets of different sensors types and real-life problems: multimodal EmoPain dataset for chronic pain physical rehabilitation context, weDraw-l Movement dataset for maths problem solving settings, and multimodal Unige-Maastricht Dance dataset. To foster work across datasets, we also challenged participants to take advantage of the data across datasets to improve performances and also test the generalization of their approach across different applications.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={130-131},
  abstract={Collaboration is an important feature of scientific practice. Scientists share, discuss and critically argue over different representations of a problem with others when attempting to generate new knowledge. Similarly, collaboration can be beneficial for inquiry-based science learning at school. Successful collaborative learning, however, relies on engaging students in a condition of positive interdependence. In this paper we propose that asymmetric simulations provide an innovative way to establish positive interdependence among students during inquiry learning which will foster the development of their collaboration skills. Asymmetric simulations divide some information or resources necessary to solve a problem unevenly among group members, thereby requiring more equal participation and contribution among all members during collaboration. The asymmetric simulations we developed are available online for free via the Go-Lab portal (golabz.eu) and therefore can be easily integrated into a digital lesson by school teachers. They were created taking into account the small screen sizes of smart devices such as smartphones or tablets, thereby making them convenient for collaborative work in school classrooms.},

  abstract={In today's world with ever increasing amount of text assets overloaded on web with digitized libraries, sorting out these documents got developed into a feasible need. Document clustering is an important procedure which consequently sorts out huge number of articles into a modest number of balanced gatherings. Document clustering is making groups of similar documents into number of clusters such that documents within the same group with high similarity values among one another and dissimilar to documents from other clusters. Common applications of document Clustering includes grouping similar news articles, analysis of customer feedback, text mining, duplicate content detection, finding similar documents, search optimization and many more. This lead to utilization of these documents for finding required information in a competent and efficient manner. Document clustering required a measurement for evaluating how surprising two given information are. This dissimilarity is often estimated by using some distance measures, for example, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean distance, etc. In our work, we evaluated and analyzed how effective these measures are in partitioned clustering for text document datasets. In our experiments we have used standard K-means algorithm and our results details on six text documents datasets and five most commonly used distance or similarity measures in text clustering.},

  abstract={Human brain is a vital organ in the human body which has more than 100 billion nerves. They communicate through synapses. Few important things governed by brain are memory, emotions, creativity, intelligence etc. The human mind has three fundamental functions like figure out, react and relish. These functions of the mind are guided by one native egocentrism or potential rational capacities. Egocentric inclination happens involuntarily. ASD better termed as developmental delays. It can cause challenges in social interaction, behaviour and communication. Diagnosis of Autism includes both psychological and neurological examination. Early detection of the neurological markers with the help of MRI can help in to more accurate diagnosis. A combination of S-MRI (Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and Rs-fMRI (Resting State- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in learning all characteristics of brain. Full brain connectivity and signal intensities of Region of Interest can be acquired using various atlases. ASD destroys the structure of the functional connectivity between the multiple brain regions. Deep learning methods proves to be successful in classification of imaging data. Provided with multi modal details provided by different MRI procedures, using a deep learning network can provide accurate classification results. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks can help in classifying whether the person has ASD or not. Given a FC matrix of the brain it is really huge to differentiate the significant features. Thus, it is requiring for dimensionality reduction. So, the purpose of using deep learning model using MRI is to identify Autism in early stage and to start with therapies.},

  abstract={At present, group cooperative learning has received widespread attention as an important mode of independent and inquiry learning. However, during the implementation process, many students were not clear about their learning goals and did not like to discuss research with their classmates. It leads to learning to stay on the surface of formality. In order to solve the above problems and improve the effect of group cooperative learning, many researchers have conducted extensive explorations from the perspective of tools and strategies. Among them, the knowledge graph can visualize the relationship between knowledge points. It characterizes the changes in students' cognitive status during the learning process, guides learners to construct knowledge autonomously, and provides the possibility to solve problems such as the confusion of knowledge structure. At the same time, studies have shown that collaborative knowledge construction has a significant promotion effect on teachers' online learning, and is beneficial to teachers' professional development. Technologically supported collaborative knowledge construction can not only promote the efficiency of knowledge acquisition, but also enhance the effect of communication and interaction, and increase the degree of participation in learning. It is an effective method to enhance the depth and breadth of the interaction of students' learning. Therefore, this study combines the construction of knowledge graphs and group cooperative learning to create a group knowledge graph learning tool based on a group to explore its influence on learners' knowledge ability level and interactive characteristics.},

  abstract={Because railway locomotives are complex and highly correlated with each other among its components, it is difficult to make Criticality evaluation by using traditional methods. In the present work, a criticality evaluation index model of the locomotive is established and the Monte Carlo simulation method is employed to obtain the criticality priority of the railway locomotive components. Based on the analysis and method, a program for general calculation is developed and applied to the criticality analysis on DF4D locomotive. The case showed that this method is an effective way to evaluate the criticality of the components of the railway locomotive. In addition, the new method of evaluation of criticality is more objective and suitable for practical situations since the analysis, for example, demonstrates that the equipment components with low failure rate have a high criticality priority. Furthermore, the method is convenient by employing Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, this improved analysis method on the criticality analysis has a practical impact on making decision for the maintenance mode of complex equipment, i.e., railway locomotive.},

Automated FER systems had been developed and have been used to recognize humans' emotions but it has been a quite challenging problem in machine learning due to the high intra-class variation. The first models were using known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayes classifier, Fuzzy Techniques, Feature Selection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in their models but still, some limitations affect the accuracy critically such as subjectivity, occlusion, pose, low resolution, scale, illumination variation, etc. The ability of CNN boosts FER accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have emerged as the greatest way to produce the best results in FER in recent years. Various datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models. FER2013, CK+, JAFFE and FERG are some of the most popular datasets. To improve the accuracy of FER models, one dataset or a mix of datasets has been employed. Every dataset includes limitations and issues that have an impact on the model that is trained for it. As a solution to this problem, our state-of-the-art model based on deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network architectures (CNN) with supportive techniques has been implemented. The proposed model achieved 93.7% accuracy with the combination of FER2013 and CK+ datasets for FER2013.},

With SBSE techniques increasingly providing insights into difficult software modeling problems, the role of the software engineer might be thought of as diminishing. However, given the crucial role of the model understanding in SBSE, we argue that the role of the software engineer will become more important through interactive SBSE, although exploiting this interaction remains a challenge for the field.},

At the same time, the main goal of the information based educational environment should be to ensure the transition of education to a new level of quality, i.e., to a state corresponding to the development of the information society and the associated need of specialists of appropriate skill levels. Currently, there is an active search for new forms and methods of teaching, which makes it possible to talk about the transition of education from a directive model to an interactive, learner's personality-oriented, more productive, one. The article deals with the possibility of using innovative teaching methods in preparing technical university students. Also, advantages and disadvantages of traditional and innovative teaching methods are described, through the development, application and implementation of innovative technologies.},

  abstract={The ABET engineering criteria was first formulated and introduced to the American education system in the middle 1990s. The ABET accreditation system defines an engineering graduate according to Blooms Taxonomy. As a part of the continuing curriculum improvement at Bucknell University, a new junior-level design course has been recently introduced into the curriculum. The course title is ECEG 301: Praxis for Engineering Design. The objectives of this course are manifold, but is primarily designed to pave the way to improved student performance in senior design projects, promote team-work and hands-on experiences, and to enhance student completion of ABET outcomes, particularly criteria (c to h). Examples of the course contents include computer aided design (Solidworks®), 3-D printing, design process elements, functional decomposition, fabrication, implementation, and simulation of photovoltaic systems. The course also aims at introducing students to crucial and current societal and environmental issues. In this paper, the results of the multiple projects are discussed. Based on anecdotal data analysis and feedback from students and faculty, the assigned projects have encouraged students' creativity and enhanced their ability to work on multidisciplinary teams. The inclusion of similar courses in undergraduate engineering curriculum would definitely improve students' hands on experiences and prepare them for more complex design challenges.},

  abstract={The impact of new technology on higher vocational education(HVE) has attracted the attention of many domestic scholars. The current direction of education informatization research is mostly smart classrooms. Therefore, schools will inevitably promote education informatization through the use of smart classrooms, and smart classrooms with classroom teaching(CT), teacher-student activities, and Internet + education will also become the core. This article uses experimental analysis and questionnaire survey methods to experiment on the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE, compare and analyze the learning effects of the experimental and control classes of computer professional courses, and investigate and analyze their attitudes to the application of the intelligent classroom model. The experimental survey results show that the outstanding students in the experimental class has more students than that in the control class, and the learning effect is better than the traditional mode in the smart CT mode of deep learning, and most students in the experimental class prefer the use of the smart classroom mode. It can be concluded that it is necessary to study the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE. In the intelligent classroom teaching system, data mining, K-means algorithm and MapReduce framework are comprehensively applied. By analyzing various behavioral data of students in school, the potential value behind these data is mined, so as to improve the construction of intelligent classroom and promote the improvement of higher vocational education.},
