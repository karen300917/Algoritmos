  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most popular technologies that have emerged in recent years, and its reputation comes from its importance and its real role in changing things for the better, we started from smartphones that opened a new perspective for the technical world around us, and later came cloud computing with new thinking and mindset about the use of computational powers. The tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning are then shown and a new horizon of computing power and capabilities is spreading, and recently with the advent of the IoT we may see a different technological future, the IoT has changed technical realities and created a real need to redefine computing. Its wide spread created many intelligent environments, such as smart homes and smart cities, that facilitate the life around us. Although it leads to significant development, there are still doubts about the security concepts in IoT-based systems. In this paper, a design of IoT architecture is proposed, and it displays the security challenges, issues, and requirements of the smart home/cities security, it discusses security attacks in IoT systems, then the security countermeasures that can be followed and takes on a real-life scenario on an IoT-based environment.},

  abstract={Advances in wireless technology have resulted in pervasive deployment of devices of a high variability in form factors, memory and computational ability. The need for maintaining continuous connections that deliver data with high reliability necessitate re-thinking of conventional design of the transport layer protocol. This paper investigates the use of Q-learning in TCP cwnd adaptation during the congestion avoidance state, wherein the classical alternation of the window is replaced, thereby allowing the protocol to immediately respond to previously seen network conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how memory plays a critical role in building the exploration space, and proposes ways to reduce this overhead through function approximation. The superior performance of the learning-based approach over TCP New Reno is demonstrated through a comprehensive simulation study, revealing 33.8% and 12.1% improvement in throughput and delay, respectively, for the evaluated topologies. We also show how function approximation can be used to dramatically reduce the memory requirements of a learning-based protocol while maintaining the same throughput and delay.},

  pages={511-522},
  abstract={Although mutation analysis is considered the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite, hefty computational cost often limits its use. To address this problem, various mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking to reduce the number of mutants while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive mutation analysis. While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.},

  abstract={There is a strong worldwide movement which is pushing for the teaching of serious computer science principles besides reading, writing and basic numeracy starting from first grade and reaching all students across all grades. This is being done through both formal initiatives carried out by international organizations and at the national level by putting forward curricula, some of which are mandatory. In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities. Recent reports have pointed out the need for supporting the international community of teachers by providing assessment methods, an internationally validated question repository as well as tools and assessment platforms. In this context our work presents an assessment platform for formative, summative and informal assessment of computer science competencies by using a visual language, namely App Inventor, which allows for the rapid development of a mobile app and has a strong appeal to the younger generation of students. The capability to log user activity allows the teacher to monitor the progression in the student's learning path as well as her/his solution-building approach.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={106-110},
  abstract={Current desktop-GIS software cannot answer users' spatial questions directly. The GIS functionality is hard to identify and use without specific training of GIS skills because of the complex hierarchical organization and the gap between users' spatial thinking and systems' implement descriptions. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for designing a question-based user interface that integrates different levels of ontologies (spatial concept ontology, domain ontology and task ontology) to guide the process of extracting the core spatial concepts and translating them into a set of equivalent computational or operational GIS tasks. We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services. The semantic framework would be useful to enhance the ability of spatial reasoning in web search engines (e.g. Google semantic search) and answering questions in location-based services as well (e.g. iPhone Siri assistant).},

  pages={97-102},
  abstract={Supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE) protocol delivers promising public and secret key sizes over other post-quantum candidates. However, the huge computations form the bottleneck and limit its practical applications. The modular multiplication operation, which is one of the most computationally demanding operations in the fundamental arithmetics, takes up a large part of the computations in the protocol. In this paper, we propose an improved unconventional-radix finite-field multiplication (IFFM) algorithm which reduces the computational complexity by about 20% compared to previous algorithms. We then devise a new high-speed modular multiplier architecture based on the IFFM. It is shown that the proposed architecture can be extensively pipelined to achieve a very high clock speed due to its complete feedforward scheme, which demonstrates significant advantages over conventional designs. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multiplier has about 67 times faster throughput than the state-of-the-art designs and more than 12 times better area efficiency than previous works. Therefore, we think that these achievements will greatly contribute to the practicability of this protocol.},

  year={2019},
  volume={23},

  pages={1479-1489},
  abstract={Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It has been proposed that this disorder is related to disrupted brain connectivity, which has been verified by many studies. With the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), further exploration of brain connectivity was made possible. Region-based networks are commonly used for mapping brain connectivity. However, they fail to illustrate the connectivity within regions of interest (ROIs) and lose precise location information. Voxel-based networks provide higher precision, but are difficult to construct and interpret due to the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we adopt a novel high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model – $\psi$-learning method, which can help ease computational burden and provide more accurate inference for the underlying networks. This method has been proven to be an equivalent measure of the partial correlation coefficient and, thus, is flexible for network comparison through statistical tests. The fMRI data we used were collected by the mind clinical imaging consortium using an auditory task in which there are 92 SZ patients and 116 healthy controls. We compared the networks at three different scales by using global measurements, community structure, and edge-wise comparisons within the networks. Our results reveal, at the highest voxel resolution, sets of distinct aberrant patterns for the SZ patients, and more precise local structures are provided within ROIs for further investigation.},

  abstract={Active Methodologies allow an active process in teaching and learning contents, promote responsible student involvement and bring satisfaction and enrichment to educational practices and active learning. Generally, students have learning difficulties in Computer Science courses, as they need to develop computational skills and thinking. The goals of this article is to characterize and analyze the types of Active Methodologies that are being applied in teaching and learning activities in Computer Science. Thus, this investigation was carried out through a Systematic Mapping Study, focusing on the use of the types of methodologies in view of the results achieved. It presents students’ perceptions, benefits, and difficulties in adopting these methodologies in the classroom. The results show 6 types of different Active Methodologies used in 35 publications selected, different types of techniques or studies that were used, the publications trend per year, the courses that were worked in analyzed publications, and some benefits and difficulty related to the adoption of Active Methodologies. Regarding to students’ perception, we identified different type feelings. Thus, the contributions of this study consist in a research focused on the use of Active Methodologies in a very broad sense, including the perceptions of teachers and students regarding the use of different teaching and learning methodologies. In addition, it shows the specific benefits and possible difficulties experienced in the use of Active Methodologies as teaching strategies. Consequently, some findings from this study may have the potential to support or direct choices of these methodologies in different Computer Science courses.},

This article addresses the fundamentals of cloud computing, as well as security and threats in various applications. This research study will explore how security is remaining as a potential risk for cloud users across the globe by listing some of the cloud applications. Some viable solutions and security measures that could help us in analyzing cloud security threats are reviewed. The analyzed solutions include profound analytical thinking on how to render the solutions more impactful in each scenario. Several cloud security solutions are available to assist businesses in reducing costs and enhancing security. This study discover that if the risks are taken into consideration without any delay then the matter of solutions gets divided into four pillars, which will assist us in obtaining a more comprehensive knowledge. Visibility, compute-based security, network protection, and lastly identity security are referred as four pillars.},

  pages={416-426},
  abstract={The computational demands of multimedia data processing are steadily increasing as consumers call for progressively more complex and intelligent multimedia services. New multi-core hardware architectures provide the required resources, but writing parallel, distributed applications remains a labor-intensive task compared to their sequential counter-part. For this reason, Google and Microsoft implemented their respective processing frameworks MapReduce and Dryad, as they allow the developer to think sequentially, yet benefit from parallel and distributed execution. An inherent limitation in the design of these batch processing frameworks is their inability to express arbitrarily complex workloads. The dependency graphs of the frameworks are often limited to directed acyclic graphs, or even pre-determined stages. This is particularly problematic for video encoding and other algorithms that depend on iterative execution. With the Nornir runtime system for parallel programs, which is a Kahn Process Network implementation, we addressed and solved several of these limitations. However, it is more difficult to use than other frameworks due to its complex programming model. In this paper, we build on the knowledge gained from Nornir and present a new framework, called P2G, designed specifically for developing and processing distributed real-time multimedia data. P2G supports arbitrarily complex dependency graphs with cycles, branches and deadlines, and provides both data- and task-parallelism. The framework is implemented to scale transparently with available (heterogeneous) resources, a concept familiar from the cloud computing paradigm. We have implemented an (interchangeable) P2G kernel language to ease development. In this paper, we present a proof of concept implementation of a P2G execution node and some experimental examples using complex workloads like Motion JPEG and K-means clustering. The results show that the P2G system is a feasible approach to multimedia processing.},

In certain cases, AI and NLP can handle healthcare functions even well than individuals. One of the area in which machine learning along with natural language processing can work is psychological diseases. Anomalous thinking, emotions, and actions are characteristics of mental illnesses. Aberrant inner interactions and actions that defy social expectations could indicate the existence of a cognitive disease. This research paper proposes a cognitive disease prediction model for psychological disorders like, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.

  abstract={The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is becoming a widely used tool in image processing and other data analysis areas. A non-conventional variation of a spatiotemporal 3D DWT has been developed in order to analyze motion in time-sequential imagery. The computational complexity of this algorithm is /spl Theta/(n/sup 3/), where n is the number of samples in each dimension of the input image sequence. Methods are needed to increase the speed of these computations for large data sets. Fortunately, wavelet decomposition is very amenable to parallelization. Coarse-grained parallel versions of this process have been designed and implemented on three different architectures: a distributed network represented by a distributed network of Sun SPARCstation 2 workstations: two Intel hypercubes (an iPSC/2 and an iPSC/860); and a Thinking Machines Corporation CM-5, a massively parallel SPMD. This non-conventional 3D wavelet decomposition is very suitable for coarse-grain implementation on parallel computers with proper load balancing. Close to linear speedup over serial implementations has been achieved using a distributed network. Near-linear speedup was obtained on the hypercubes and the CM-5 for a variety of image-processing applications.<>},

The paper presents a novel approach to interactive storytelling: SAGE (Storytelling Agent Generation Environment), a construction kit that supports children's creation of their own wise storytellers to interact with. In this system, programming is a vehicle for the transformation of ways of thinking about communication as well as for constructing knowledge about technology. In order to encourage children's emotional engagement in the SAGE environment, the storytellers are embodied in an interactive stuffed animal-a soft interface-which is also programmable by the children. The paper presents some technical aspects of SAGE's design and implementation and focuses on empirical results from research with children using SAGE.},

The results for fully configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64 k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes. The authors show the similarity of the CM-2 and Y-MP programming models and comment on selected future massively parallel processor designs.<>},

  abstract={Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.},

  abstract={Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.},

  abstract={Computational and data-intensive science increasingly depends on a large Web Service infrastructure, as services that provide a broad array of functionality can be composed into workflows to address complex research questions. In this context, the goal of service registries is to offer accurate search and discovery functions to scientists. Their effectiveness, however, depends not only on the model chosen to annotate the services, but also on the level of abstraction chosen for the annotations. The work presented in this paper stems from the observation that current annotation models force users to think in terms of service interfaces, rather than of high-level functionality, thus reducing their effectiveness. To alleviate this problem,we introduce Functional Units (FU) as the elementary units of information used to describe a service. Using popular examples of services for the Life Sciences, we define FUs as configurations and compositions of underlying service operations, and show how functional-style service annotations can be easily realised using the OWL semantic Web language. Finally, we suggest techniques for automating the service annotations process, by analysing collections of workflows that use those services.},

  abstract={Whilst there has been growing interest in the use of social robots in educational settings, the majority of this research focuses on learning outcomes, with less emphasis on the social processes surrounding these interactions. One such understudied factor is children’s trust in the robot as a teacher. Trust is a relevant domain in that if and how children trust a robot could influence their subsequent learning outcomes. The extent to which the robot’s behaviour (including making errors) influences trust is yet to be fully explored. Consequently, the goal of this research is to determine the role of trust in children’s learning from social robots. We report a pilot study investigating the conceptualisation and measurement of chil-dren’s trust in robots. 33 children aged between 4-9 completed a computational thinking learning task with a NAO robot at a Science Festival. Observations of the interactions in terms of developing tasks and measurements for child robot interaction are discussed. The findings tentatively suggest children’s trust in the robot can be divided into two parts: social affiliation towards the robot, and perceived competence/reliability of the robot.},

  abstract={This paper is about a particular technical problem in the study of autonomy in constructed complex systems: how can a computing system decide that it needs a new symbol system to re-express all of its own processes? We have shown earlier that a constructed complex system will need to change its symbol system, by proving two theorems that limit what it can do with a fixed symbol system. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. In this paper, we show how a constructed complex system can decide that it needs to change its symbol system, and how it can do it. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas.},

  abstract={Mobility-on-demand systems are transforming the way we think about the transportation of people and goods. Most research effort has been placed on scalability issues for systems with a large number of agents and simple pickup/drop-off demands. In this paper, we consider fair multi-vehicle route planning with streams of complex, temporal logic transportation demands. We consider an approximately envy-free fair allocation of demands to limited-capacity vehicles based on agents' accumulated utility over a finite time horizon, representing for example monetary reward or utilization level. We propose a scalable approach based on the construction of assignment graphs that relate agents to routes and demands, and pose the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Routes for assignments are computed using automata-based methods for each vehicle and demands sets of size at most the capacity of the vehicle while taking into account their pickup wait time and delay tolerances. In addition, we integrate utility-based weights in the assignment graph and ILP to ensure approximative fair allocation. We demonstrate the computational and operational performance of our methods in ride-sharing case studies over a large environment in mid-Manhattan and Linear Temporal Logic demands with stochastic arrival times. We show that our method significantly decreases the utility deviation between agents and the vacancy rate.},

Such tools allows the user to program while manipulating blocks that represent programming languages instructions. iVProg is among this class of tools and was firstly implemented in Java and could be integrated to Moodle using iAssign. Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle. In addition, we give some teaching support whenever integrated using iVProgH with Moodle using iAssign.},

  abstract={Machine-learning algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in embedded sensing applications, by enabling the analysis of signals derived from physically complex processes. Given the severe resource constraints faced in such applications (energy, functional capacity, reliability, etc.), there is the need to think about how the algorithms can be implemented with very high efficiency. This paper examines the opportunities on three levels: (1) inherent resilience against computational errors, enabling some degree of fault tolerance; (2) top-down training of statistical models using data explicitly affected by errors, enabling substantial fault tolerance; and (3) bottom-up specification of inference kernels based on preferred hardware implementation, enabling reduced hardware complexity. Implementations employing the last two approaches are proposed and evaluated through hardware measurements and simulation.},

  abstract={Protein-Protein docking is a recent practice in biological research which involves using 3D models of proteins to predict the structure of complexes formed by these proteins. Studying protein-protein interactions and how proteins form molecular complexes allows researchers to better understand their function in the cell. Currently, the most common methods used for docking are fully computational approaches, followed by the use of molecular visualization tools to evaluate results. However, these approaches are time consuming and provide a large number of potential solutions. Our basic hypothesis is that a virtual reality (VR) framework for molecular docking can combine the benefits of multimodal rendering, of the biologist's expertise in the field of docking, and of automated docking algorithms. We think this approach will increase efficiency in reaching the solution of a docking problem. However designing immersive and multimodal virtual environments (VE) based on VR technology calls for clear and early identification of user needs. To this end, we have analyzed the task of protein-protein docking as it is carried out today, in order to identify benefits and shortcomings of existing tools, and support the design of new interactive paradigms. Using these results, we have defined a new approach and designed a multimodal application for molecular docking in a virtual reality context.},

The student projects move beyond basic theory verification by requiring students to practice higher-level thinking, and students are able to physically observe the results of their own computational solutions to problems. The student projects encourage students to reorganize knowledge, understand computation in the context of larger systems, and discover the connections among several disciplines.},

In spite of this, in the Chilean higher education system, as in most parts of the world, teaching programming is a challenging endeavor, partly because the majority of freshmen students in STEM undergraduate programs have not been introduced to the fundamentals of the discipline and its applications in K12 education. Therefore, students' attitudes, engagement, and autonomous learning can make a difference in how students in STEM disciplines in higher education face their first programming course. In the present study, we carried out measurement of variables associated to these constructs involving a sample of 1694 freshmen of seventeen STEM programs in a Chilean research university. Relevant differences were found among different STEM programs, and by student gender. Implications of the results obtained and future research avenues are discussed.},

  abstract={Scratch is a popular programming platform with plenty of learning resources. However, it is quite difficult for users to find suitable resources. In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset.},

  abstract={The so called associative thinking, which humans are known to perform on every day basis, is attributed to the fact that human brain memorizes information using the dynamical system made of interconnected neurons. Retrieval of information in such a system is accomplished in associative sense; starting from an arbitrary state, which might be an encoded representation of a visual image, the brain activity converges to another state, which is stable and which is what the brain remembers. In this paper we explore the possibility of using an associative memory for the purpose of enhancing the interactive capability of perceptual vision systems. By following the biological memory principles, we show how vision systems can be designed to recognize faces, facial gestures and orientations, using low-end video-cameras and little computational power. In doing that we use the public domain associative memory code.},

The paper focuses on the programming and Maths aspects, being fundamental to IoT development, in addition to computational thinking and coding concepts for the HE students. The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present our findings of investigating non-linear multi-target tracking techniques when jointly used with object classification. The transferable belief model (TBM) is utilized in the multi-target evaluation, data association, and target classification stages. A particle filter is used to track each of the targets and uses a motion model that is relevant to the classification given to that target. The targets are classified based upon their motion throughout the scene and their land based position. We show how this system can deal with prior knowledge and lack of knowledge. Situations, with data of this type, regularly occur in real world scenarios and we think it is very important that any system must be able to cope well to such situations. Bayesian and regular DST methods have shortcomings when dealing with such scenarios. We show that the TBM approach can be generally more computational tractable and more robust.},

  abstract={As the number of teachers teaching computer science grows, it is increasingly important to be mindful of the training they receive with respect to broadening participation in computer science. Through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS A. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled “Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education” that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course.},

  abstract={Plagiarism is known as an unauthorized use of other's contents in writing and ideas in thinking without proper acknowledgment. There are several tools implemented for text-based plagiarism detection using various methods and techniques. However, these tools become inefficient while handling a large number of datasets due to the process of plagiarism detection which comprises of a lot of computational tasks and large memory requirement. Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU. Thus, introducing GPU based optimization algorithm to the plagiarism detection gives a real solution while handling a large number of data for inter-document plagiarism detection.},

Therefore, while teaching evolutionary programming to students of Computer Science, we decided to equip them with the technical details and then let them explore the creative aspects themselves. As part of the introductory course on Artificial Intelligence, an evolutionary generation of art is an assignment The teaching goals were to inform students of creative aspects of EA as well as invoke critical thinking and analysis in them. The students generated images via EA, and the only restriction was on the pixel size for input. The assignment was well-received, despite its complexity. Students engaged with the art generation and felt confident in expressing their perspectives of creativity and art The assignment evaluation as a contest allowed for judges from diverse domains such as Computer scientists and artists. The goals of the course are met as the students were trained not only in technical details but also realized the capacity and generative power of algorithms, as they practically simulated and expressed their creative thoughts via this contest Furthermore, the students engaged with the philosophical foundations of computational creativity effectively by the design process, and a report completed along with the work required them to develop their own artistic exegesis of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Buffer overflow is one of the most dangerous and common vulnerabilities in CPS software. Despite static and dynamic analysis, manual analysis is still heavily used which is useful but costly. Human computation harness humans' time and energy in a way of playing games to solve computational problems. In this paper we propose a human computation method to detect buffer overflows that does not ask a person whether there is a potential vulnerability, but rather a random person's idea. We implement this method as a game called Bodhi in which each player is shown a piece of code snippet and asked to choose whether their partner would think there is a buffer overflow vulnerability at a given position in the code. The purpose of the game is to make use of the rich distributed human resource to increase effectiveness of manual detection for buffer overflows. The game has been proven to be efficient and enjoyable in practice.},

  abstract={Machine learning is a new paradigm of problem solving. Teaching machine learning in schools and colleges to prepare the industry's needs becomes imminent, not only in computing majors, but also in all engineering disciplines. This paper develops a new, hands-on approach to teaching machine learning by training a linear classifier and applying that classifier to solve Multirotor Activity Recognition (MAR) problems in an online lab setting. MAR labs leverage cloud computing and data storage technologies to host a versatile environment capable of logging, orchestrating, and visualizing the solution for an MAR problem through a user interface. This work extends Arizona State University's Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment (VIPLE) as a control platform for multi-rotors used in data collection. VIPLE is a platform developed for teaching computational thinking, visual programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics application development.},

  title={Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.},

  abstract={Most countries in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) have adopted national development plans that recognize ICT as the main driver for economic development. For ICT to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ICT literate. As a result, a number of countries have developed Subject Policy Guidelines aimed at introducing Computer Studies at Secondary School level. While most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ICT infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. Subsequently, most African student's first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the Computer Science major without any prior hands-on experience. The Namibian Technology Outreach to Secondary Schools (NAMTOSS) initiative is a pilot program started by the School of Computing (SoC) at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in March 2016. NAMTOSS is a partnership between secondary school teachers, learners and the staff members of the School of Computing at UNAM that is designed to introduce computer programming skills and computational thinking at secondary school level. NAMTOSS attempts to address the structural and systemic issues raised by previously unsuccessful outreach efforts conducted in Southern Africa. In this paper, we enumerate the successes and failures of our initial outreach efforts and suggest several enhancements to our program that we feel will lead to its success.},

  abstract={The last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to Computer Science (CS) education, especially for K-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in CS and Computational Thinking (CT). Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. We describe a detailed AI/ML lesson plan based on standards and framework, AI4K12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to $\boldsymbol{4}^{\mathbf{th}}$ grade students in an elementary school.},

  volume={},

  pages={4070-4080},
  abstract={Why do people think Tom Hanks and Juliette Lewis look alike? Can we modify the gender appearance of a face image without changing its identity information? Is there any specific feature responsible for the perception of femininity/masculinity in a given face image? Those questions are appealing from both computer vision and visual perception perspectives. To shed light upon them, we propose to develop a GAN based approach toward face gender transfer and study the relevance of learned feature representations to face gender perception. Our key contributions include: 1) an architecture design with specially tailored loss functions in the feature space for face gender transfer; 2) the introduction of a novel probabilistic gender mask to facilitate achieving both the objectives of gender transfer and identity preservation; and 3) identification of sparse features (≈ 20 out of 256) uniquely responsible for face gender perception. Extensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate not only the superiority of the proposed face gender transfer technique (in terms of visual quality of reconstructed images) but also the effectiveness of gender feature representation learning (in terms of the high correlation between the learned sparse features and the perceived gender information). Our findings seem to corroborate a hypothesis about the independence between face recognizability and gender classifiability in the literature of psychology. We expect this work will stimulate more computational studies of different face perception attributes including race, age, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.},

  abstract={Our concepts of biology, evolution, and complexity are constrained by having observed only a single instance of life, life on earth. A truly comparative biology is needed to extend these concepts. Because we cannot observe life on other planets, we are left with the alternative of creating Artificial Life forms on earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic evolution (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what amounts to another universe, governed by the “physical laws” of the logic of the computer. This exercise gives us a broader perspective on what evolution is and what it does. An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium. These are not models of life, but independent instances of life. This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to understand and respect the natural form of the artificial medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities inherent in the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process for the production of complex computer software.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed system meant for secure computation and information sharing platform free from any central authority that enables multiple authoritative domain which do not trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in rational decision-making process. Bitcoin is pioneer crypto currency platform that uses blockchain technology but over the time it has moved beyond Bitcoin and has successfully bypassed to other application domain. Beside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger and Corda, Quorum have emerged as a successful distributive computing platform. Major consortium like Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Hyperledger and R3 are formed with aim to come up with business solution. Today we have different blockchain application in public sector, finance, supply-chain, healthcare and IoT. In many industries people think blockchain will be transformative. Financial sector is most enthusiastic in adopting blockchain followed by supply chain management. Blockchain is closely looked at in India too. In 2018 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a white paper in order to identify the potential application areas of blockchain in Indian banking. NITI Aayog is working on national strategy for blockchain which will identify the area where country can implement blockchain. Blockchain is still new and has issues like scalability, security and privacy breaches, limited transaction loads, and high (computational) costs, besides its technical problem, adopting blockchain into Indian market system has its own specific challenges. This paper discusses the prospect of blockchain technology in India, its current position and likely problem in its adoptation to Indian market place. This paper also give overview about blockchain and its fundamental technologies and prominent blockchain platform, it also gives account of application area's in which blockchain is implemented successfully around the world.},

  abstract={Digitization is becoming part of almost everyone’s life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. This has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. Our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers.},

The proposed algorithm is called the compact firefly optimizer (cFO). It uses a compact representation to store the population of the fireflies. Thus, the whole population is represented by a probabilistic distribution function. The compact swarm intelligence proposed allows the reduction of the computational capacity required to evolve the population toward the optimal solution. An important numerical test is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained show that the proposed compact firefly optimizer (cFO) is very competitive. Furthermore, the new concepts of compact swarm robotics are also introduced. The algorithm is applied to describe the first compact swarm robotics system. The objective is to realize an optimal stable walking by bipedal robot. Discussions, propositions and analysis let to think to a new important starting point for an emerging field of compact swarm intelligence, robotics, search and optimization.},

  year={2024},
  volume={17},

  pages={498-513},
  abstract={Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.},

  abstract={Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is a computational thinking methodology where roles provide an underlying mechanism to facilitate abstraction, classification, separation of concerns, dynamics, and interactions. From a meta theoretical perspective, the specification of groups, roles and agents is a critical element of RBC. In consideration of the relationships and hierarchies faced by groups, roles and agents, we propose a minimal role playing logic system (MRPL) through substructural logic, which is polynomial in complexity, in support of RBC. From MRPL and RPLs extending from it, there are three levels of application, i.e., the global level governing how people organize agents to form a group; the concatenative level for role assignment with respect to logic and algebra, and the operational level governing properties, relations and structures that should appear in collaborative system design. From MRPL to RPLs, one can extend it to suit other appropriate applications.},

  abstract={Embodied interaction concerns the way that user senses the environment, acquires information, and exhibits intention by means of physical action. In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spatio-navigational type of problems.},

  abstract={The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).},

  abstract={With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveSMART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition.},

  abstract={In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design.},

  abstract={Frequently, the existing resources in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), used in distance education courses and blended, are presented in the same way for all students. This may complicate the effective learning process of each student. In order to solve this problem, one of the original goals of intelligent educational systems is to guide every student to the most appropriate educational contents. So, the approach adopted in this paper is based on a framework called ArCARE (Conceptual Framework of Educational Resources Adaptation in Virtual Learning Environments), which allows adaptation of resources for students in VLEs, allowing the construction of their knowledge, using multi-agent system technology that handles an open learner model ontology. These ArCARE resources are recommendation and adaptation of collaborative activities such as Pedagogical Architectures for the students have a more effective learning of particular course content. Results obtained from some tests in a flexible curriculum course of Computational Thinking show the feasibility of the proposal.},

  abstract={This research explored the degree of learning self-efficacy of machine learning experience (MLSE) and artificial intelligence learning anxiety (AILA) of elementary and junior high school teachers. The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.},

  abstract={In recent years, industries have been moving with tremendous speed towards "green thinking" as never before. Proceeding into a more circular economy will offer benefits such as reducing environmental burdens, enhancing the protection of raw material supply, increasing competition, promoting productivity, boosting sustainable economic growth and creating employment. Remanufacturing leads to circularity, while reverse supply chains pose difficulties. Closed loop supply chains are prioritized for reverse supply chain networks. However, alternative supply chains and different market actors make remanufacturing possible through open loops. In this study, a new integrated mathematical approach is proposed to address designing a multi-stage, multi-product and multi-period open loop reverse supply chain network which maximizes the profit and utilizes reverse logistics to benefit the environment in the most efficient way. The proposed approach presents a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) that uses water treatment facility along with the common components of open loop reverse supply chain (OLSC). The objective determines the facility location and material flows between stages in each period. Using a realistic network instance, computational results are used to verify the feasibility of the study.},

  abstract={A Virtual Reality (VR) ambiance can simulate real-world scenarios and problems, allowing students to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations. The design of the VR ambiance should align with the learning objectives and provide relevant challenges and tasks that require students to use their computer technology skills to solve problems. A well-designed VR ambiance can encourage exploration and creativity in computer technology students. By providing a virtual space that allows experimentation and innovation, students can explore different approaches, test ideas, and think creatively when solving problems. This paper studies how students and professors evaluated the development of competencies during an extracurricular project for the development of a virtual interactive environment for learning a process. Designing an interactive virtual environment will require the implementation of various interactive elements, such as 3D objects, user interfaces, and animations. Students can apply their programming skills to create the necessary functionality in the virtual environment. To create an attractive and easy-to-use virtual environment, students will need to consider UX design principles. In this case, the competencies to be measured were: Solving problems generating efficient computational algorithms under models and tools of computer science and developing software applying process and quality standards of Software Engineering. To assess compliance with the development of competencies, it was decided to develop an interactive virtual environment; this is a process that involves several stages, from conceptualization to implementation and testing. The objectives of the virtual environment were established. In this case, it was decided to develop an environment that would help the user learn how to change a flat tire. A plan was created detailing how users will interact with the virtual environment. Early results show that more than 50% of the students outstandingly developed problem-solving competence, additionally, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed the competence in a more than acceptable way would go up to 93%. These results, also show that more than 70% of the students outstandingly developed software development competence. In addition, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed competence in a more than acceptable way would rise to 92%.},

  abstract={The climate of the planet is going through some mayor changes. Most of the climate scientists agree upon anthropological activities being the main cause of this, due to the CO2 and other GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Road transportation also contributes to air pollution and to the local pollution in big cities, due to the emissions of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and polluting gases such as NOx, CO, SO2 among others. Those problems and the continuous increase in emission limits given by regulators all over the world, are demanding for a change in the current transportation paradigm, leading to a completely electrified solution for both the private and public vehicles. This is particularly true for those cities that relay thoroughly on bus system as main public form of transport. Even though the Colombian capital, Bogota, is a big city with about 10 million people, it does not have a subway or other electric type of massive transport systems, but it has developed a big and articulated bus system. With the aim of shifting part of this system, namely the trunk lines of the Transmilenio company, to an electric one, this work analyses the problematic of the charging needs. To calculate the energy consumptions, computational simulations on two lines, C29 and B11, have been performed based on three different solutions proposed to address the charging problem. The aim of this work is the comparison of different technical solutions to find the best one in financial terms (also in the form of type and dimension of the bus accumulators in a true first principles thinking) and the estimation and inclusion of the buses’ cost.},

In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.},

  abstract={Scientific and technological progress has promoted social change, and digital technologies such as big data, the Internet, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things have begun to develop, changing human thinking structure, living habits, learning behaviors, communication methods, and production technologies. Big data, as a hot topic in current digital technology and digital development, is based on massive data and generates value through computational analysis. It has been applied in various fields and different scenarios. China has issued the “Overall Layout Plan for Digital China Construction” document, which clarifies the need to accelerate the construction of Digital China, promote digital technology innovation, improve the digital governance system, and enhance digital security capabilities. The digital reform and development of education is an important part of the construction of a digital China, and it is an inevitable path to achieve the modernization of China's education. The development of digital education requires innovative digital applications in teaching methods, teaching resources, teaching evaluation, educational governance, and actively promoting the application of digital technologies such as big data and cloud computing in specific educational scenarios. The performance management of university teachers, as one of the important contents of educational governance and university management, relies on big data to establish a data governance system for the performance management of university teachers, which is precisely the demand for the digital development and construction of education. This article explores the application of big data in the digital construction of performance management for university teachers from three aspects: background, definition and characteristics of big data, and digitalization of performance management for university teachers. With big data as the core and data governance as the goal, big data application design is carried out from three perspectives: improving the digital performance system for university teachers, digitizing the performance content of university teachers, and designing a big data platform for university teacher performance management.},

  abstract={If I were to point to a group of professionals who are constantly updating their mental models and technological frameworks to correspond to new social and scientific knowledge, I would choose doctors. As a layperson, I think about the tangle of race in medicine a lot because my own experience with it doesn&#x0027;t fit neatly into computational categories. I am a Black woman with light skin, and people often don&#x0027;t know what racial or ethnic category to put me in. I&#x0027;ve been asked if I am Black, white, Puerto Rican, Egyptian, Israeli&#x2014;the whole spectrum. For the purposes of medical forms, I usually write that I am multiracial. My mother was white, my father was Black, and I want my doctors to be aware of any genetic or epigenetic factors that might be inherited along either family line. As the cultural conversation about race has evolved over the years, I&#x0027;ve noticed my doctors adapting their practices.},

  abstract={Jeff Raskin coined the term Information Appliance at Apple Computer in 1978. Martin Libicki advanced the concept of the Battlespace from his 1996 Telemetry of War essay in which our modern notion of netcentric warfare was advanced. Using these concepts we incorporate the modern information technology phenomena of everyware and persistent computing toward evolution in new forms of human enhancement. Given that most if not all humans will eventually equate to information devices in persistent computing architectures - we refer to them in this research as Human Information Appliance (HIA). This project is first and foremost a futures oriented product for the purpose of thinking about - in advance - risk and resilience analysis and management for a time that is beginning to feel familiar - if yet to come. We apply the HIA concept in a futures scenario where the arrival of exponential computational speed may produce effects to create novel solutions for human-machine environments/spaces. This form of human enhancement may also pose significant risk that requires a public ethical analysis toward prescriptive policy work in the present.},

It is well known that the operation of interpretative transcription of texts written in Cyrillic is extremely laborious, but it will solve a problem of great interest to humanities researchers who are concerned with the study of the Romanian language in its diachronic evolution. We think that the present study will impact the humanities research, including that of paleography, history, archaeology and that field of linguistics interested in the study of the language in diachrony, but it will also help the researchers in the field of computational linguistics that develop models for old language, in order to develop a diachronic POS tagger, so necessary to recover old lemmata.},

New encryption methods are being developed and improved from time to time. "AES" (Advanced Encryption Standard) is one such encryption protecting machine, which offers fine grained access control. Think of the ABE as a Cipher Scheme. However, the expressive mode of the ABE method can be problematic for the ABE in interpreting the key clarification and result in a low computational performance for the key problem and key decryption. To fix this issue, several outsourced versions of the Chinese Abacus (a concrete plane not made of beads on sticks), were built to improve the reliability of its use.

  abstract={As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues.},

  abstract={Problem based learning has been adapted by various universities and inscribed with perspectives based on the demographic challenges. The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process.},

  abstract={Switching to talking about algorithms involves a sharp break from the previous discussion. We set aside, for the moment, thinking about psychology, social science, art and creativity studies and consider what it is that we can do with computers and how this is being used to achieve the goals of computational creativity. The study of algorithms belongs to what Herbert Simon described as The Sciences of the Artificial,<superscript>2</superscript> where we do not study the world as it is, out there, but study our own built environment and the process of building that environment, which we can do in an interactive, probing manner through the production of new designs and inventions. In Simon&#x0027;s words, &#x201C;engineering, medicine, business, architecture, and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent&#x2014;not with how things are but with how they might be&#x2014;in short, with design.&#x201D; I begin this chapter by returning to a theme from chapter 1, the essential distinction between processes of generation and evaluation in creativity, which will help frame the relations between algorithms in the construction of artificially creative systems.},

  abstract={The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.},

  abstract={The push to develop low-stakes and personally meaningful computer science experiences is creating novel opportunities to broaden participation in CS. These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper aims to introduce a methodological framework to foster Computational Thinking (CT) skills by teaching programming with Educational Robotics (ER) in High School. Problem-solving is an essential skill for human development, so it is necessary to introduce actions to improve this skill in High School. It is possible to stimulate problem- solving through computer programming teaching with ER. However, as far as we know, there are no methodologies for teaching programming with ER focusing on CT development in High School that went through scientific validation of the proposal. This study is an Educational Design Research that aims to introduce a methodological framework for teaching programming in High School with ER (named CTProgER) and validate two instances of the framework. It was considered consolidated teaching methodologies with ER, combined with the Anthropological Theory of Didactics and evidence from our ER studies. As a result, we present the CTProgER Framework guideline, two instances of the CTProgER Framework, and these instances’ validation through the Delphi method.},

  abstract={Today, teaching faces several challenges, including students’ difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and lack of motivation. To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel automated approach to medical data classification using an interval type-2 fuzzy thinking system (IT2FLS) and wavelet transformation (WT). Wavelet coefficients are highly discriminative features that serve as condensed reconstructions of the underlying data. Uncertainty and high-dimensional data provide issues that are addressed by the combination of WT and IT2FLS. With the use of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for unsupervised structure learning and evolutionary algorithms for supervised parameter adjustment, the IT2FLS employs a hybrid learning approach. The use of WT streamlines this computationally demanding learning process, lowering computational load and improving IT2FLS performance. Well-known medical datasets (Cleveland heart disease and Wisconsin breast cancer) from the UCI Collection for machine learning are used for experimental assessments. Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The findings demonstrate the better efficacy of the wavelet-IT2FLS methodology in comparison to other machine learning techniques, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, fuzzy ARTMAP, support vector machine, and probabilistic neural network. The suggested approach has potential to assist clinicians and medical professionals in making decisions.},

The idea of “artificial intelligence” may be characterized as “any sort of artificial computational framework that exhibits shrewd lead, i.e., confounded direct that is successful for appearing at focuses on.” This definition envelops the conceivable outcomes of “artificial intelligence.” Minsky said that we ought to abstain from restricting “intelligence” to exercises that explicitly require data, whether or not they are performed by people. This proposes that we ought to join various machines, including those that illustrate “specific PC based intelligence that show just bound limits in learning or thinking anyway outperform presumptions at the robotization of explicit errands, likewise as machines general artificial intelligence that expect to make a by and large canny overseer.” Robots are the fake experts filling the role of real people. The fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer programming are the ones that meet up to frame robotics, which is a “part of recreated intelligence” that arrangements with the association, improvement, and use of robots. A theory on artificial intelligence can be viewed as here. The improvement of PC systems has made it conceivable to achieve undertakings that previously required the intelligence of a human. A few instances of these errands incorporate visual segregation, the affirmation of discussion, the arrangement of bearing, and the investigation of tongue contrasts. The subject matter expert, who is the “performer” in this reference, brings forth the item and polishes itself off in the body of the hardware. This is the key piece of the reference. The association between these two is that the control of the robot is an item expert that looks at input from the sensors, comes to a choice on what to do right away, and afterward guides the effectors to act in reality. The reason for this study is to give essential, basic measurements on two arising progressions: artificial intelligence (recreated intelligence), and robotics, as well as how much they are available in India. Consequently, the range of the things being examined is the primary significant part of these two disciplines. Moreover, it is feasible to portray them as being testing, engaging, and between disciplinary in nature.

  abstract={There has been an increasing interest in objects within the HCI field particularly with a view to designing tangible interfaces. However, little is known about two key issues in tangible interface design: how people make sense of objects and; how objects support thinking. This paper draws upon a study of how engineers learn from mechanical products as a starting point for considering how to design interactions with physical objects that have embedded computational capabilities, that is, hardware in the tangible digital domain. The key lessons are to design devices that support interaction and user inquiry. Mechanical devices are intelligible when they: give feedback; can be reconfigured; and perform differently in different contexts. These qualities allow their users to develop inquiry processes and to gradually build a repertoire of familiar devices and operating principles.},

  abstract={Suppose that you are the boss of a company and you want to accomplish a specific task through two groups of employees. Where, one group involves old and expert employees and the other consists of young and inexperienced ones. In this case, we think that your best choice is to establish a teamwork from both groups to ensure this mission will be done rapidly with high quality, of course, if the team members could work in consistence with each other. In this research, we are interested in investigating the benefit of applying this concept in search with two groups, one consists of a set of informed algorithms with different complexity based on their search mechanism, and the other group includes a collection of heuristic functions has varying degree of simplicity based on their informedness. The main goal of our study is the distinguishing of work teams that should be used to improve the efficiency of exploring the search space of a sliding-tile puzzle. The actual computational time of our experiments proved that choosing a proper teamwork can rapidly find optimal solutions by professionally exploiting the heuristic informedness and reducing the algorithm complexity.},

  abstract={The teaching of programming is a critical topic in our society. Given the Science and Technology initiatives, these topics are considered in different training cycles: primary, secondary and higher education. In the case of higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for developing computer applications, which contribute to not only the knowledge of programming languages but also open guidelines for computational thinking. In previous research, we evaluated a set of platforms under a usability lens; on this occasion, we compare these results and their impact on the learning outcomes. We evaluated three experimental groups that used video game platforms to achieve their learning outcomes. Additionally, we will synthesize the literature regarding new paradigms of programming education under immersive environments.},

  abstract={In service to the state of the art, advances are required toward redesigning the framework over which web applications are built. The semantic web lies at the intersection of web and machine understandable meaningful data, turning it into intelligent ‘web of data’. The key requirement with any intelligent system has been to find a concrete knowledge representation that can make the inferences within time and space constraints; that is, reasoning effectively and efficiently within the resource constraints posed to the problem at one hand and with insufficient data as well as incomplete knowledge on the other hand. Various Knowledge representation schemes have been proposed in the literature, each having its limitation over the others. Ontology is the key component for semantic web engineering. Ontologies are conceptual knowledge bases providing a systematic and taxonomical description of the concepts and instances under consideration. Conceptual clarity in the computational representation of a concept is vital for holistic thinking and knowledge engineering. In order to meet the needs of an application/enterprise, knowledge should be presented taking care of all possible perspectives; and represented in a hierarchical structure with differing levels of granularity. This paper discusses about bringing all the manifestations of an ontological concept/decision under one umbrella; hence describing the resultant scheme as a unit of knowledge. By representing a concept as a knowledge unit, classical ontology is claimed to be sufficient in dealing with imprecise, vague and heterogeneous knowledge for real-world web applications; and portrays the capability to acquire fresh knowledge through its thorough interaction with the external world in a given working environment.},

  abstract={Picture the following three scenarios. You have an elderly uncle named Buck. Given his advanced age, on rare occasions, Uncle Buck forgets to take his prescribed dosages of phenytoin and azathioprine, both lifesaving medications. Stephanie, your best friend's niece, has spent the last two weeks in pain and requires risky surgery to dislodge a foreign object that has become stuck somewhere in her gastrointestinal tract. Once a week, you worry about an increased heartrate, shortness of breath, and begin to wonder whether you should slow down your run. A company, Visceral Data, begins producing smart pills to assist in each of the above three cases. Currently, numerous partners and organizations in academia, government, and the private sector are in fact building ingestible computational technologies that would feature prominently in each of the above scenarios, including the policy frameworks that govern them.1 As former Alphabet executive chair Eric Schmidt once stated, “You will—voluntarily, I might add—take a pill, which you think of as a pill but is in fact a microscopic robot, which will monitor your systems” and share information about what is happening in your body (Bilton 2013).},

  abstract={In a recent article I discussed some of the possible research benefits for anthropology of applying the computational paradigm of artificial life (AL) to the scientific study of cultural evolution. I referred to this program as artificial culture (AC). Culture, in this view comprises not only the cognitive processes of individuals (what they think), but includes their behaviors (what they do), and the products of their labors (what they make) as well. AC comprises a population of individual agents, each with its own sensors, cognizers, and actuators interacting with other agents, with products of their own manufacture, and with an external world containing objects and limited and resources situated on a grid. All inanimate objects are given a materiality constrained by a physics, and animate objects are further constrained by a metabolism. Further specifications, potentials and constraints are discussed here for a simplified implementation called T.I.E.R.S. (Trade, Information Exchange, and Risk Sharing). Along with robot sociology, this strategy may help to clarify the role of the individual in society, the dynamics of cooperation and competition, and the general epistemology of emergence.},

  abstract={End-to-end reliability is an important issue in building large-scale distributed enterprise applications based on multi-tier architecture, but the support of reliability as adopted in conventional replication or transactions mechanisms is not enough due to their distinct objectives - replication guarantees the liveness of computational operations by using forward error recovery, while transactions guarantee the safety of application data by using backward error recovery. Combining the two mechanisms for stronger reliability is a challenging task Current solutions, however, are typically on the assumption of simple transaction pattern where a request from a single client executes in the context of exactly one transaction at the middle-tier application server, and seldom think about some complex patterns, such as client transaction enclosing multiple client requests or nested transactions. In this paper, we first identify four transaction pattern classes, and then propose a fault-tolerant scheme that can uniformly provide exactly-once semantic reliability support for these patterns. In this scheme, application servers are passively replicated to endow business logics with high reliability and high availability. In addition, by replicating transaction coordinator, the blocking problem of 2PC protocol during distributed transactions processing is eliminated. We have implemented this approach and integrated it into our own J2EE application server, OnceAS. Also, its effectiveness is discussed in different transaction patterns and the corresponding performance is evaluated},

  abstract={Ultrasound (US) with CAD system imaging is a medical diagnostic tool which has become the most commonly performed cross-sectional diagnostic imaging technique in the practice of medicine, and also the one of the most common schemes in the medical diagnostic area to detect diseases in the clinical practice. It is also cheapest, non-ionizing, reliable, portable, and capable of real-time image acquisition, safety, convenience, and low risk, live display makes it acceptance worldwide. US is oldest but with the cult of computer science, data science (machine learning, deep learning) and chip level advancement in the ultrasound devices. This Ultrasound is all set to upgrade and change according to the advancement in evolving technology, information technology with significant challenges and opportunities. High inter- and intra-operator inconsistency and limited image quality management are the few trending issues which are prime focus of the researchers in present days. As mentioned earlier the US devices due to cult introduction of the computer science and data science has become smaller, enhanced computational capability, and become very advanced. Ultrasound also can contribute significantly to decrease changeability with its advanced image processing. However, reading ultrasound imaging is little tricky, in a proposal to make it little supportive to the clinicians and to reduce the load of doctors, many ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems with different segmentation, classifiers techniques have been launched. In recent years, the success of data science especially deep learning in the image classification and segmentation is very successful. This led to more and more scholars and researchers to think unanimously realizing that improvement in accuracy, Specificity, and sensitivity of the disease finding can be brought by utilizing the deep learning in the ultrasound CAD system. This paper reviews the research which focuses on the ultrasound CAD system utilizing Data science in recent years. Ultrasound CAD system are mainly 1. traditional ultrasound CAD system and deep learning ultrasound CAD system. The different segmentation techniques and the classifier employed in ultrasound CAD system are discussed. Performance of the different CAD systems with different techniques has accounted in the research paper in contrast accuracy, sensitivity, and Specificity in disease finding is noted. This paper will be useful for the researchers who focus on the ultrasound CAD system more over it is the base of the academic research for the fulfillment of the PhD research work.},
