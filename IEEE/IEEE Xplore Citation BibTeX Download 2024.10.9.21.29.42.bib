  abstract={In the circumstances that evidences are highly or full conflict, D-S evidence combination method may lose effectiveness, for this reason some improved methods of evidence combination are given in succession. Some scholars think, different evidence source is under different circumstance, so the importance of each evidence source is different. In the conditions that evidences are highly or full conflict, it is necessary to give weight to every evidence source, then conflict probability can only just be assigned. In this paper, we construct an evaluating standard with basic proposition and its rough combined probability value, to calculate the weight coefficient of every evidence source, based on that, conflict probability is assigned, combination of evidences is built. In this method, subjective information from decision-makers is used, and objective information from evidences is also used, only little artificial job is needed. This method can be achieved on computer easily, and satisfying consequence can be obtained.},

However, mechanics is more than interlocking of these two professions; under it we understand - beside computing (informatics) and electronics - also results of control technique, artificial intelligence and their common effect that are realised in the equipment that surrounds us.

  abstract={“India's agriculture is its lifeline.” The production of agriculture depends on fertilisers. One of the main issues that farmers face is a lack of information regarding the necessary fertiliser amounts. Farmers think that when fertiliser use rises, production rises as well. This, however, is untrue since the soil just uses what it need and leaves the remainder behind. Overuse results in leaching, a decrease in the natural fertility of the soil, and other problems. A solution is to make it possible for farmers to test their soil and use fertilisers in accordance with the needs of the soil at a reasonable cost. This study describes the development of a low-cost soil nutrient detection method using pre-made capsules. Here, it is possible to do three different nutritional tests for sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. In this experiment, three test tubes are used, and after adding varied amounts of dirt and water to each, the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. After then, the tube starts to change colour. A colour sensor is used in this instance, and it recognises the colour shift in the test tubes and compares it to the information previously known about the colour deficit. The farmer is advised of the shortage and how much fertiliser is necessary to make up for it once the sensor data is analysed using Arduino.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. An intelligent robot is different with the traditional mobile robot. The traditional mobile robot uses a powerful microcontroller to control the movement, with the help of sensing devices it normally is able to make a tactic decision but could not do any sophisticate thinking since the limitation of the computation power provided by microcontroller. However, the intelligent robot adds a separate layer of computation core, such as laptop or a single motherboard, on the top of the movement control microcontroller. That means, by adding a "brain' the traditional mobile robot is upgraded to an intelligent machine, which is capable to undertake many sophisticate environment sensing and decision making. The prototype version of the intelligent management algorithm for swarmed intelligent robots has been simulated using Matlab and it is currently tested and evaluated using advanced intelligent robots system.},

  abstract={The Internet has a unique promise for transaction cost reduction within an enterprise as well as across enterprises. However, the traditional planning frameworks are confined to organizational boundaries and typically do not embrace the concept of an extended enterprise where all external constituencies of an enterprise are considered as a part of the enterprise. Yet, crossing the traditional organizational boundaries is precisely what the concept, methods, and techniques of Internet envision. To fully reap the benefits of Internet technology, an organization must be willing to seek out new opportunities and engage new thinking to extend its horizon into extended enterprises and ultimately the global village as manifested in the Internet community. A new planning framework espousing this vision is, thus, needed for Internet enterprises. We applied a reference model for this purpose and analyzed its use with some case studies in banking and heavy machinery industries. In this paper we describe the model and the methodology for planning for Internet in businesses.},

  abstract={Maintenance of the patient respiratory passage (airway) open and unobstructed breathing is a foremost duty of an anesthesiologist or other physicians who are involved in patient care under emergency situations. One of the main reasons for respiratory related problems is unanticipated difficult airway (unexpected difficulty in maintaining the face mask or passing an endotracheal to maintaining the continuous opening of the airway). If the doctor under duty fails to keep the airway open, it may lead to death or permanent bodily harm of patient, because of inadequate oxygenation. There is no readily available software solutions at present for predicting the exact probability of difficulty in mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Hence there is an urgent need to develop an expert system solution to support the anesthesiologists in predicting the risk and think about the remedial approaches to prevent the future consequences. The hard dealing with the advancement of a uniform categorization of patient safety has hindered the current advances in patient safety. This paper presents a prediction system to deal with difficulties in airway management using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python tools. This expert system aims to support the doctors in the case of prediction of difficult parameters of the patients associated with the airway management.},

  abstract={Classifying foetal health is a crucial responsibility in healthcare, and innovative machine learning techniques can be utilised to help. In this instance, K-nearest neighbour, Nave Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers are used to fine-tune an input picture dataset. The adjustment is done on these classifiers using methods like feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tweaking. Through the identification of the ideal parameters and feature combinations for your dataset, these strategies assist in improving the performance of the classifiers. To enhance the sustainable effectiveness of the classifier, you may also think about pre-processing methods like normalisation or dimensionality reduction. For the categorization of foetal health in this solution, three models are used and compared, with K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes classifier, and Decision Tree classifier showing 90%, 84.5%, and 93% accuracy, respectively when machine learning optimization techniques are applied using pre-trained model.},

  year={2013},

  pages={672-687},
  abstract={The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.},

  abstract={Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as one of the most important methods to tackle multiple criteria decision-making problems, has achieved much success over the past several decades. Given that linguistic expressions are much closer than numerical values or single linguistic terms to a human way of thinking and cognition, this paper investigates the AHP with comparative linguistic expressions. After providing the snapshot of classical AHP and its fuzzy extensions, we propose the framework of hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP, which shows how to yield a decision for qualitative decision-making problems with complex linguistic expressions. First, the comparative linguistic expressions over criteria or alternatives are transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements and then the hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) are constructed. Considering that HFLPRs may be inconsistent, we conduct consistency checking and improving processes after obtaining priorities from the HFLPRs based on a linear programming method. Regarding the consistency-improving process, we develop a new way to establish a perfectly consistent HFLPR. The procedure of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP is given in stepwise. Finally, a numerical example concerning the used-car management in a lemon market is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP method.},

  abstract={Self-assembling DNA complexes have been intensively studied in recent years aiming to achieve bottom-up construction of nanoscale objects. Among them a DNA complex called the DNA tile is known for its high programmability. DNA tiles can form 2-D crystals with programmable patterns via self-assembly. In order to create a wide range of complex objects by algorithmic self-assembly, we need a methodology to predict its behavior. To estimate the behavior, we can use thermodynamic simulations based on the Monte Carlo method. However, the previous simulation model assumed some simplified conditions and was not able to adequately explain the results of crystal growth experiments. Here, we propose the realistic tile assembly model, in which we are able to simulate the detailed conditions of the experimental protocols. By this model, the results of experiments (e.g., error rates, growth rate, and the formation and melting temperatures) are reproduced with high reliability. We think this model is useful to predict the behavior of DNA self-assembly and to design various types of DNA complexes.},

  year={2021},
  volume={5},
  number={4},
  pages={714-723},
  abstract={Domain adaptation aims to improve the performance of the classifier in the target domain by reducing the difference between the two domains. Domain shifts usually exist in both marginal distribution and conditional distribution, and their relative importance varies with datasets. Moreover, there is an influence between marginal distribution distance and conditional distribution distance. However, joint domain adaptation approaches rarely consider those. Existing dynamic distribution alignment methods require a feature discriminator, and they need to train a subdomain discriminator for each class. Besides, they don't think about the interaction between the two distribution distances. In this article, we propose a dynamic joint domain adaptation approach, namely Joint Domain Adaptation Based on Adversarial Dynamic Parameter Learning (ADPL), to deal with the above problems. Both marginal distribution alignment and conditional distribution alignment can be implemented by adversarial learning. The dynamic algorithm can keep a balance between marginal and conditional distribution alignment with only two domain discriminators. In addition, the dynamic algorithm takes the influence between the two distribution distances into consideration. Compared with several advanced domain adaptation methods on both text and image datasets, all classification experiments and extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that ADPL has higher learning performance of classification and less running time. This reveals that ADPL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.},

  year={2017},
  volume={16},
  number={6},
  pages={383-399},
  abstract={Since its inception, DNA computing has advanced to offer an extremely powerful, energy-efficient emerging technology for solving hard computational problems with its inherent massive parallelism and extremely high data density. This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers.},

  abstract={In this paper, first, relationship between bipolar-valued fuzzy set and fuzzy set with its extensions is discussed. Second, a new order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets is introduced. Contrary to the existing YinYang order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets, which focuses on the “equilibrium” monotonicity, the new proposed order relation is concerned with “preference” monotonicity. And then, some new operations and related properties about the new defined order relation are presented. Third, by combining bipolar-valued fuzzy set with the rough set theory, the concept of the bipolar-valued rough fuzzy set is developed, which is the first attempt to consider inconsistent bipolarity into rough set theory. Particularly, by introducing two new operations to the rough set theory, the widely existing information losing problem in the computation process is solved. Furthermore, parameter-related and parameter-free rough degrees about the bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in a crisp approximation space are introduced. Finally, the bipolar-valued fuzzy decision information system is given; then, both the attribute reduction method and the knowledge discovery method based on the proposed roughness degree are presented. An example is included to show the feasibility and potential of the obtained theoretical results.},

  title={Quantum Pythagorean Fuzzy Evidence Theory: A Negation of Quantum Mass Function View}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={30},
  number={5},
  pages={1313-1327},
  abstract={Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is an effective methodology to handle unknown and imprecise information because it can assign probability into the power set. However, the process of obtaining information is a complex task, which can consider the rational, conscious, objective evaluation of utility with behavioral effects. Besides, in most cases, information can be obtained from different angles at the same time. The quantum model of mass function (QM) uses amplitude and phase angle to easily express those properties of information that can extend D-S evidence theory to the unit circle in a complex plane. Moreover, everything in nature will have its opposite, which is a kind of universality. The Bayes theorem is essentially the process of negation. However, in most cases, decisions can be made by only fully considering the known information without considering the other side of the information. Hence, considering the negation of information is a question to be investigated deeply, which can analyze information from the other point. This article proposes negation of QM by using the subtraction of vectors in the unit circle, which can degenerate into negation proposed by Yager in standard probability theory and negation proposed by Yin et al. in D-S evidence theory. Negation can provide us more information to consider the problem from both positive and negative aspects. In this article, negation can be understood information, which does not belong to event $A$, that is to say, negation can be regarded as nonmembership by using the fuzzy terms. Based on the above discussion, this article proposes the quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET), which is the novel work to consider QPFET from the point of negation. Besides, there are some numerical examples to explain the proposed method. In order to explore the applications of QPFET, this article discusses the possibility of the VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method under QPFET to handle multicriteria decision-making that enables us to capture 2-D data, considering not only amplitude but also phase angle.},

  title={Two-Stage Learning Based Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Reduction Approach}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={26},
  number={5},
  pages={2938-2952},
  abstract={In this study, a new two-stage learning based reduction approach for fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is introduced in order to reduce the number of concepts. FCM is a graphical modeling technique that follows a reasoning approach similar to the human reasoning and the decision-making process. The FCM model incorporates the available knowledge and expertise in the form of concepts and in the direction and strength of the interactions among concepts. One of the modeling problems of FCMs is that oversized FCM models suffer from interpretability problems. An oversized FCM may contain concepts that are semantically similar and affect the other concepts in a similar way. This new study introduces a two-stage model reduction approach, and both static and dynamic analyses are considered without losing essential information. In the first stage, the number of concepts is reduced by merging similar concepts into clusters, whereas in the second stage the transformation function parameters of concepts are optimized. In order to show the benefit of using the proposed reduction approach, two sets of studies are conducted. First, a huge set of synthetic FCMs are generated, and the results of these statistical analyses are presented via various tables and figures. Subsequently, suggestions to the decision makers are given. Second, experimental studies are also presented to show the decision parameters and procedure for the proposed approach. The results show that after using the concept reduction approach presented in this study, the interpretability of FCM increases with an acceptable amount of information loss in the output concepts.},

  year={2021},
  volume={29},
  number={6},
  pages={1695-1700},
  abstract={Induced ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are important extensions of OWA operators and can suit more different decision environments. However, when practitioners perform induced OWA operators, they frequently do not consider the tied values in inducing information, therein lay the problem of possible non-uniqueness of aggregation results. From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness. As an example of flexibly formulating complex preferences under the proposed concepts, a novel investigators-consultants-decision maker (ICD) two-stage IOWA evaluation model is clearly proposed and illustrated.},

  year={2020},
  volume={28},

  pages={3376-3390},
  abstract={Fuzzy knowledge representation and reasoning is one of the key research subjects of artificial intelligence with uncertainty. Currently, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) cannot describe fuzzy nondeterministic knowledge based on the variable fuzzy criterion clearly. To solve this problem, we present an extended FPN model based on the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation. First, the mechanism and the principles of the variable fuzzy criterion under qualitative mapping are introduced. The important theoretical basis of qualitative mapping is detection and integration of perceptual attribute features. Under transition degree function and the qualitative criterion transformation, the qualitative mapping better reflects the cases in which the fuzzy membership criterion is variable. Second, we use the characteristics of the qualitative mapping to propose a structure of attribute fuzzy information granule. Based on the logic operation of fuzzy information granule, we redescribe the four fuzzy production rules which are commonly used, and obtain four kinds of fuzzy qualitative judgment rules. They can explicitly express the occurrence process of transition nodes of FPNs, which strengthens the uncertain knowledge representation ability of FPNs. The new method makes it easy to construct a learning mechanism based on cognition in FPNs.},

  abstract={Economy of Bangladesh mostly depended on agriculture. As a small country, our population is over the limit. We are also a developing country also. For national GDP growth must be to increase the production. Every year a huge amount of agricultural production losses for the crop disease. As we know most of the farmers in our country are illiterate, have no proper knowledge about the disease, that's why they cannot manually detect the disease. I think if you properly detect the disease at the early stage we can solve the issue. We develop a model that can classify leaf disease. We focus on 5 major production crops in Bangladesh. Using computer vision technique our farmer will get the benefit. We use convolutional neural networks for classifying images. An algorithm cannot properly capture the features of existing data that's why we use a pre-trained feature extraction method that is MobileNetv2. MobileNetv2 is very useful for mobile devices. The research contains the proportions of validation accuracy of 90.38%. This approach resulted in the agriculture sector that will help a farmer to classify disease from harvest. The main goal of our model is to minimize the damage of suffering plants that can help to the growth of production. By solving this issue themselves farmers can also reduce cost. Our goal is that they can cure their crop at the right time. To achieve this goal we tend to think that we should develop a way to detect the leaf disease. We collect several kinds of cucumber leaves. And then any leave can be tasted by our model. By using our model we try to reduce the leaf disease.},

  abstract={In systems synthesis the basic lesson-and the hardest to accept-is that not all engineering problems can be or should be solved by deduction from mathematical and scientific principles. Synthesis is provisional and qualitative, a way of thinking different from the definitive, quantitative thinking of analysis. Its technique and tools reflect this difference. In synthesizing the system's initial concept, three qualitative techniques are fundamental: heuristics, metaphors, and models. Heuristics are brief statements of lessons learned in the past and applicable to the present situation. Metaphors transpose the implicit behavior of a system to a more familiar context, one example is the desktop metaphor for personal computer operating systems. Models are used to present different perspectives of a proposed system to multiple stakeholders so that everyone has a common frame of reference for discussion. Progressive modeling emphasizes the continuing refinement of models during system development than, say, an initial sketch to full-scale simulator. Each of these qualitative techniques are discussed.},

AI has provided new ideas to software engineering, but most of its gems stayed buried in the laboratories, available only to a limited number of AI practitioners. Should AI tools be integrated into mainstream tools? And can this be done? We think it is feasible and that both communities can benefit from this integration. In fact, some efforts in this direction have already taken place, both from major industrial standardization bodies such as OMG and from academic laboratories. The example presented here should inspire readers to think about integrating their work with mainstream tools.},

Precision timing, gravity sensors and imagers, cryptography, navigation, metrology, energy harvesting and recovery, biomedical sensors and imagers, and real-time optimisers all indicate the potential for quantum technologies to provide the basis of a technological revolution. From the field of Systems Engineering emerges a focused strategy for the development cycle, enabling the existence of hugely complex products. It is through the adoption of systems thinking that the semiconductor industry has achieved massive industrial and economic impact. Quantum technologies rely on delicate, non-local and/or entangled degrees of freedom - leading to great potential, but also posing new challenges to the development of products and industries. We discuss some of the challenges and opportunities regarding the implementation of Systems Engineering and systems thinking into the quantum technologies space.},

Texts on social networking sites can automatically detect an individual’s personality qualities. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset is being used in our research paper, consisting of 16 categories of postings with an amount of 8675 posts. We classified four personality traits from the input text, namely Introversion-Extroversion (I-E), Intuitions-Sensing (N-S), Feeling-Thinking (F-T), and Judging-Perceiving (J-P). We have initially adopted several preprocessing techniques to fit these text data into our proposed machine learning model. Text preprocessing methods include tokenization, word stemming, stop words deletion. After preprocessing, features like tf-idf and countvector were extracted. The model was then trained with six state-of-the-arts classifiers. After evaluating the model, it was found that the SVM outperformed all other classifiers and proved better than the other existing works also.},

Together these components seek to support six strategies of metacognition, metacognitive scaffolding, reflective prompts, self-assessment, self-questioning, self-directed learning, and graphic organizers. This paper focuses on the implementation and integration of the first two components of the model, thinking processes and organizational strategies into a web application.

Since the system requirement enforces us to choose an open standard platform, and we think that Java has matured enough to offer acceptable performance and reliability, we decide to implement it by Java. Basically, this training simulator is a distributed interactive application, and lots of messages are exchanged within it. For the performance reason, we use an IP-multicast-based Java message service (JMS) implementation as the communication infrastructure for delivering time-critical events. In this paper, we present how to exploit the capability of the JMS publish/subscribe paradigm to implement this training simulator. Besides, we also perform a set of experiments to test and verify whether the training simulator can meet the system requirement. We think the experience of this paper is a good case study of using Java and message-oriented middleware to build message-intensive distributed systems.},

With the continuous development of social economy, science and technology and information network technology, traditional landscape design has also achieved a "quality" leap. The appropriate use of computer-aided software in landscape design has become an essential skill for landscape designers. Computer-aided software is like a pen in your hand, a tool that shows the designer's ideas and thinking. How to make students master computer-aided design software and use it reasonably in landscape design is a problem that current landscape design teachers need to think about and study. The existing CAD software for garden landscapes has limited expression of 3D models and virtual simulation effects, and can only be used for 2D construction drawing. In order to solve the dynamic landscape characteristics, a three-dimensional landscape design simulation system of virtual reality technology was developed. Object-oriented parametric 3D solid modeling method was used to realize 3D solid modeling, 3D real-time virtual rendering of design scenes, renderings and animations. Production, construction drawing and other functions, and explored the system computing principles, implementation methods and OpenGL extensions and other related technologies. Then the overall function of the system is briefly introduced, and the simulation process in the professional module is discussed in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is verified by an engineering example.},

  abstract={All the youngsters, nowadays, are not keen to developing their knowledge. Moreover, the students are easily addicted to mobile phones. So, the performance level decreases and reduces their thinking ability as well technology has grown, all the answers are now available in the internet. If they search since the internet, they get their answers directly but without knowing the base from how it came. Therefore, everyone is trying to reach the upcoming technologies without strong in their basics. Hence, a model is created with the help of toolkit (like courseware, etc.) where the technology behind this is AI. This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.},

  abstract={Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) is a crucial research area in natural language processing. Inspired by the idea of large language model Chain of Thought(CoT), this paper intro - duces a Sentiment Analysis of Thinking (SAoT) framework. The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in the text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities. Then, it reflects on the process of implicit sentiment analysis, and finally, it deduces the polarity of sentiment. The model is evaluated on the SemEval 2014 dataset, consisting of 1120 restaurant reviews and 638 laptop reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the utilization of the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model yields a notable performance improvement. Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score reaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer dataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46. Comparatively, the ERNIE- Bot-4+SAoT model surpasses the BERTAsp +SCAPT baseline by an average margin of 47.99%.},

  volume={8},

  pages={288-299},
  abstract={Recently, many researchers have applied Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to multi-label learning tasks by establishing relations among labels. However, these researchers have only used GCN as an auxiliary module and have lacked exploration of object relations, which has limited the inference capability of GCN. Applying GCN to multi-label classification in information systems poses significant challenges to address because information systems are considered as a graph with only nodes and no edges. This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems. The effectiveness and significance of performance of MG-GCN has been verified through ranking-based indicators and hypothesis tests, respectively.},

  abstract={Mobile-edge computing (MEC) system is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing capacities at the edge of radio access network (RAN) which is close to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to promote QoS by offloading the computationally intensive tasks to the MEC server. There are many papers discuss this issue. Nevertheless, most of them just think over one-dimension resource allocation, radio resources or computation resources, and make the MEC system less effective. Hence, we consider the allocation of both radio resources and computation resources of the MEC server to increase system effectiveness. Apart from this, we take the variety of tasks' requirements into account. That is, we assume that different tasks may have different delay requirements. We formulate this problem as a cost minimization problem and design a heuristic algorithm to address it. Numerical results show that our algorithm can greatly promote QoS.},

Some of these advances reflect a natural but incremental conceptual evolution in a maturing science, but others can be attributed in part to the ever cheaper, more ubiquitous, powerful, and mobile computing. As a result, personality science in the 21st century is a fast-moving field poised to answer important questions across diverse areas, but it is also facing increasingly complex challenges related to assessing and summarizing the important features of human behavior. Computer science and engineering may hold the key to the next advances in personality science. In what is intended to serve as a complement to Vinciarelli and Mohammadi's Survey on Personality Computing , contemporary thinking and research in personality are summarized, the mounting importance of computing in personality research is highlighted, and an outline for future directions in personality computing is offered.},

However, IoT has no uniform architecture and there are different kinds of attacks on the different layers of IoT, such as unauthorized access to tags, tag cloning, sybil attack, sinkhole attack, denial of service attack, malicious code injection, and man in middle attack. IoT devices are more vulnerable to attacks because it is simple and some security measures can not be implemented.

  abstract={Sentiment analysis research mainly aims to determine the orientation of an opinionated stretch of text into positive or negative polarity. The key motivation of sentiment analysis is getting to know what consumers think about products and services by analyzing their opinions on online portals, blogs, discussion boards, reviews etc. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the information of POS-based sentiment-rich phrases in a machine-learning algorithm that determines the semantic orientation of a given text. In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features. Therefore, a feature selection method is used to select only relevant features from the feature vector. Experimental results show that the combination of prominent unigrams and bi-tagged phrases outperforms other features for sentiment classification in a movie review dataset.},

But a human has some qualities which can never be gained by a machine like creativity, empathy, sensing, and critical thinking. By aggregating the best sides of both, a novel paradigm for the judicial system can be anticipated. For this purpose, we prepare a dataset both from an online survey (n=103) and interviews conducted in Bangladesh on cases related to `Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000'. We apply several machine learning algorithms to make a machine that can predict punishment like a judge and calculate both the test accuracy and the predictive power of the models to observe which algorithm performs better and stable than the others. Even human can guide machine for judging a delinquent.},

Therefore, a kind of special data mining technique appeared, it called Recommender System. Most research of recommender system always provides the most relevant items for users or items. However, recommendations from traditional recommender system may not satisfy the new human beings because users may already know these relevant items from other information sources. We believe that there are still some unsearched but less relevant items useful for users. On the other hand, because social network has grown very quickly, we think that there are some very useful interactive information that recommender systems can use to provide recommendations. Therefore, we propose a Social Network-based Serendipity (SNS) recommender system that uses interactive information from the social network to find out which items are interesting for users but hard to discover by themselves.},

By leveraging the cloud resources mobile user can computation time and energy benefit. However, distant cloud has several limitations such as communication delay and bandwidth make us to think for closer cloud which brings the idea of proximate cloud of cloudlet. Cloudlet has distinct advantages and is free from several limitations of distant cloud. However, limited resources of cloudlet negatively impact the cloudlet performance with the increasing number of substantial users. In this paper, we propose a framework which helps to enhance the finite resource cloudlet performance by increasing cloudlet resources. Our aim is to increase the cloudlet performance with this limited cloudlet resource and make the better user experience for the cloudlet user in mobile cloud computing. We analyze and explain the each section of the proposed framework. In addition, we also list the important features and salient advantages of Performance Enhancement Framework of Cloudlet (PEFC).},

It also references the `pictorial' and `affective' turns in theory in order to discern `what avatars want', a play on the cultural theorist W. J. T. Mitchell's ideas. We propose that `truth' or `real' has very little to do with how we feel about our avatar creations which are in effect self-portraits. Their existence reveals our desires, yearnings, fears and insecurities. The avatar is an animated, performed image which mirrors our desire to inject it with subjectivity, while at the same time thinking of it as an object. Avatar embodiment also points us to the technological sublime. Reflecting the natural sublime, we argue that the technological version is part and parcel of our relationship to self and our avatar instantiations.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive brain disease that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills to an extent that it starts affecting the daily life. It has become the most common cause of dementia among older people. The work presented in this paper evaluates the utility of image processing on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to estimate the possibility of an early detection of AD. The total brain atrophy and specifically the hippocampal atrophy are considered strong diagnostic tests for AD. T1 weighted MRIs have been used for the purpose of image processing to evaluate atrophy. The paper demonstrates the applications of several image processing techniques such as K-means clustering, wavelet transform, watershed algorithm and also a customized algorithm tailored for the specific case. It has been implemented on the open source platforms, OpenCV and Qt, which facilitates the implementation and utility of the developed product in the hospitals without requiring any proprietary software. The results obtained from the project could aid the analysis to detect AD along with correlation with the psychiatric results and could thus assist the doctors in detecting AD at an early stage. This could progressively help in understanding and treating AD.},

In this paper we use to say about the energy harvesting by using the speed breaker mechanism. This mechanism includes the rack and pinion arrangements. Now way day's the population is thriving dramatically and the vehicles are flourishing proportional with the ascending rate of population. Ultimately the vehicles increased with the raising up the wastage of energy and in this mechanism we picks up the wastage energy for renewed it to electrical energy by thinking out of box for generation of electricity. Then the amount of electricity generation depends on the how many vehicles passed over the hump and the weight carrying of vehicles which drops on the speed breakers, so in this we got the lot's of energy to fulfill our demand in upcoming days.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the dynamic traffic grooming problem in wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) mesh optical networks subject to wavelength constraint and transceiver constraint. As an improvement over the existing link bundled auxiliary graph (LBAG) model which thinks all traffic streams must go though the grooming fabric before entering the wavelength switch fabric, we introduce a transceiver saving auxiliary graph (TSAG) model and propose the TSAG method. In the TSAG model, we can determine whether a traffic stream should consume grooming ports or not. Various grooming policies are achieved by assigning the weight value of different edges in the auxiliary graph and their blocking performance are compared through simulations. Results show that the TSAG model has a lower blocking probability than LBAG while consuming the less running time, and TSAG can reduce the number of transceivers utilized while improving the wavelength utilization.},

  abstract={In this paper, we offer an approach to software evolvability based on our wrapping infrastructure for integration in constructed complex systems. We believe that the self-modeling systems that we have built using wrappings may be able to manage their own evolution to some extent. In a wrapping-based system, the design decisions are visible in the resource definitions, with the associated context assumptions, so it is much easier to change them. We expect such a system to build and examine models of its environment, and its behavior in the environment, to check them against the specifications that define the assumptions about the use of the system, so it can call for help when they are violated. We also think we can build the system to make the changes itself in some cases. In particular, there is a class of system change causes that are known to the original system designers (usually based on uncertainties about the environment or the current state of hardware components), and the system can be built with enough information to react to those changes accordingly.},

  abstract={"SoftMan" coordination is developed from the traditional computing method, it not only exhibits those agent's features, such as autonomous, intelligent, mobile, but also applies the method of AL, and extends the distributed computing. The main advantages of the "SoftMan" paradigm lie in its ability to fully utilize network resources and to provide the best service for mobile customer. A novel digital gas fields real-time produce scheduling system (DGRPS) is presented, which is based on the theory of "SoftMan" coordination. The system architecture and software structure of DGRPS was put forward. The result of system simulation demonstrates that it is an effective method. At last, we give a novel thinking about the development of "SoftMan" system and forecast its research trend in near the future},

  year={2008},

  pages={823-828},
  abstract={This paper presents an example of using the balanced truncation method (BTM) for a distributed RLC interconnect model reduction. The example shows a surprising result and some possible hidden phenomenon in model reduction methods. We find that a high order BTM model has much worse performance than a low order BTM model, in view of the original model and their step responses in the time domain. This unexpected finding contradicts to our common expectation from the well-known approximation error upper bound results of the BTM in frequency domain. It reveals a fact that though the high order system keeps more states than the low order system, the approximation error behavior in the time domain may be totally different from its counterpart in the frequency domain. In addition, the paper also presents a closed form of the state space model for general evenly distributed RLC interconnect line circuits. The closed form has a very low computation complexity of O(1), which may be extended for use not only in circuits, but also in various complex systems with transmission lines, networks, or delay lines. Since the BTM is a popular practical model reduction method in various areas, thus this example may bring some further insight thinking for development.},

  abstract={Cognitive radio is proposed to opportunistically access the spectrum while the licensed user is idle. As a result, spectrum sensing procedure to observe primary user's existence is vital to cognitive radio. In this paper, we propose two adaptive sequential cooperative spectrum sensing techniques in time varying channel, namely the Two Stage Sequential Energy Detector and Differential Sequential Energy Detector. By utilizing past local observations from previous sensing slots, cognitive radio nodes can aggregate the current and previously received energy values to improve the detection performance. We explore the adaptive schemes, where cognitive radio user takes in previously received energy values when it thinks that the primary user's activity remains unchanged. Simulation results show that both proposed schemes provide better detection over conventional energy detection based cooperative technique. Additionally, both proposed schemes can satisfy the IEEE 802.22 standard's requirement of 10% false alarm and 90% detection in scenario that conventional techniques can not accommodate.},

With the proposed method, an image is divided into different granularities based on hierarchical thinking, and different quotient spaces are constituted according to different behaviors under different granularities of the image. The synthetic features are obtained by composing the attribute functions at different granularity levels based on the theory of composing multi-granularity attribute functions in the quotient space. Finally, the images are retrieved by the synthetic method. The experiment showed that the synthetic method could be able to effectively retrieve Thangka images.},

  abstract={Group authentication is a valid scheme to make sure whether all participants belong to the same group. For nonmembers, detecting and identifying them is also necessary. So an optimized group authentication which can detect and identify the nonmembers is proposed in this paper. The group authentication is designed for group-oriented applications. A lot of user authentication schemes only support one-to-one principle of authentication. However, network applications are no longer one-to-one communication, multiple users may be involved. So the scheme proposed a many-to-many communication. The scheme is based on Shamir's (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme. The threshold scheme can protect a secret with high security and reliability when all the participants are honest. If some dishonest participants exist, the other honest participants may obtain a false secret which will lead to a false authentication, making them think all the participants are in the same group. It can reveal the content of the communication between them. We improve the t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme, where t is the threshold of the scheme, m is the number of participants in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group. We choose a one-way function and then compute a parameter value which we will mention below. Which involve in a method to detect and identify the nonmembers in the group.},

The system structure, data representation, data storage and data access in SIMG are described with emphasis on key techniques. The data conversion and transferring between SIMG and conventional spatial databases are also discussed.

  abstract={Virtualization is very important factor to reduce cost of data warehouse deployment. It can reduce cost as well as tremendous pressure of managing devices, storage servers, application models and man power. In current era, data warehouse is very effective concept that can make huge impact in organizational decision support system. Unlike database systems, data warehouse systems take large amount of time and cost to deploy and develop in-house system for an organization. This is the reason that people now think about cloud computing as a solution of the problem instead of implementing their own data warehouse system. This paper is about, how cloud computing environment can be established as an alternative of data warehouse system. It will also throw some light about better environment choice for the organizational need. Organizational data warehouse and EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) are discussed with different parameters like ROI, security, scalability, robustness of data, maintenance of system etc. Paper will help in comparative analysis of both the systems.},

In order to accommodate as many requests as possible, Data Centers typically deploy oversubscription, which requires a thoughtfully calibrated usage of the computing and network resources of the system. We especially need to re-think the usage of network resources, as the kinds of demands from applications we see today have more stringent network requirements than in the past. The Software-Defined Network paradigm offers new tools to manage the network in agile, flexible ways, according to specific needs. It enables to build new customized functions in order, for example, to monitor the instantaneous load of traffic, slice the network, route each flow according to specific policies that can be modified accordingly with the needs of the system. In this paper we present an orchestrator for Software-Defined Data Center, and the strategies used to allocate Virtual Machines, basing our decisions on the current state of the system.},

  abstract={A technique called "Low-Cost Computing" has been attracting public attention in recent years. "Low-Cost Computing" is a method aimed at achieving the same level of performance of expensive commercial equipment or dedicated equipment by combining common, inexpensive equipment, software and services. One example of "Low-Cost Computing" is "virtual currency". Virtual currency often uses "distributed network" as an underlying technology. In a distributed network, data is stored using users' computers rather than a server for centralized data management. In short, virtual currency is realized by using the network to combine the users' computers. We think of this as "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing". There are many services using "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing", and they are becoming the mainstream of modern computers. As opposed to this, we propose "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" in this research. "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" proposed in this research means "combining commonly available devices and software to propose an environment for teleconference or remote class, and building an infrastructure with equivalent functionality to expensive systems or services". In this research, as the first step of this method, we aim to construct, with "Low-Cost Computing", a low-cost remote class environment which anyone can use. In this paper, we constructed a remote class environment with "Low-Cost Computing", and held classes at Toyo University. At the end of the remote class session, we conducted a survey on the remote class constructed in this research. Based on the survey results, we will summarize and consider the evaluation of remote class environment made available through "Low-Cost Computing".},

  abstract={Chinese sentence similarity calculation is widely used in the field of natural language processing, and the similarity calculation method is also varied. This paper introduces the similarity calculation method based on shallow Information, based on the similarity of part of speech, and also analyzes their calculation principles and calculation methods. Their advantages and disadvantages are given. At the same time, it puts forward the idea of using deep learning thinking to automatically learn the essential information of data from large-scale text data. Using the word2vec model, sentence processing is reduced to word vectors. It also proposes a method for calculating the similarity of shallow features, parts of speech features, and features of word vectors. The experimental results show that compared with the conventional method, the accuracy of the algorithm in calculating the sentence similarity is higher.},

  abstract={Divide-and-Conquer (DC) approach is a classical well-adopted paradigm for designing algorithms. In current big data scenarios, processing of voluminous and variety of data is required. One of the characteristics is, large-dimensional data that needs to be analyzed; for example, high resolution images used in social media are used for sentiment analysis. Our research is oriented towards discovering approaches where stage-by-stage processing is done to bring out most salient features from high-dimensional data. However, we observe that data block processing, in most of the conventional approaches, does not scale well for higher dimensionality. Instead, we think of making blocks along the feature set and we propose a divide-and-conquer based feature extraction framework based on feature set partitioning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using various feature set partitioning based PCA approaches.},

  abstract={Geometry is one of the oldest branches of science in mathematics that studies the shape of fields and spaces applied by architects and building technicians. Studying geometry provides many basic skills and helps to build thinking skills in analytical reasoning and problem-solving logic. Geometry is useful for understanding space in a real-life that helps in understanding better concepts. With the help of Smartphones as an information technology tool, today can simplify the calculation of a flat build. In this study will be presented the use of computer vision to calculate several types of flat shapes. The automatic calculation of the flat shape formula becomes a solution to calculate quickly to correct the answers to mathematical questions about regular or irregular flat shapes. The calculation process is done by detecting a flat shape that is taken using a Smartphone camera. Once detected, the image is converted into a binary image. Then the measurement of each pixel in the object image is measured, then the formula to be used and the calculation are processed by the application submitted. This study will utilize the Chain Code technique as a digital image processing which functions to generate codes in the form of several numbers based on the direction of the wind. This chain code can represent curves, lines, or contours of a field, determine circumference and area, and can determine the form factor of an object. From this method, it is used to detect objects and then scaling the size of objects so that the formula of the flat building that will be identified can be applied. The results showed that the detection of 2-dimensional objects was quite accurate with a percentage of 57.57% of 33 tests, and with 3 models of variation testing.},

  abstract={Granular computing is not only a computing model for computer-centered problem solving, but also a thinking way for human-centered problem solving. Some authors have presented the structures of such kind models and investigated various perspectives of granular computing from different application points of views. Theory of quotient space is a new granule computing tool. In order to solve the difficult problem using theory of quotient space, the original universe of discourse space X will be turned into the new granular universe[X]. The process actually implies the idea of extenics. Extension method is mainly used to solve contradictory problems by transformations of matter-elements. So we integrate extension method with theory of quotient space to solve some complicated problems in artificial intelligence system, and set up an extension-based quotient space computing model. It provides a good scheme to find feasible approximate solutions in the problem space and realize relations and transformations between granule and granule in the whole granular worlds. And it also provides a new method for solving difficult problem. So it has great theory significance and practical value.},

  abstract={Global networking is changing the way that we think about and perform computation. Network-based computing may link tens or hundreds of distributed devices, sensors and computing resources to support an application. Therefore, a critical challenge is how dynamically to discover and integrate these distributed services seamlessly for various applications. In this paper, many cutting-edge technologies including semantic Web, Web services, peer-to-peer network and content-based routing, are used to address this challenge. With these technologies, we propose a new framework for dynamic integration of distributed services. Moreover, a prototype system with basic capabilities is implemented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential of this framework and its constituent technologies in network-based computing.},

We compare and examine this proposed uncertainty estimation method with recommends the EA specification and Agilent specification.

  abstract={Since years the Surge Protective Devices (SPD) are widely used to protect the sensitive equipment connected to the AC distribution network against lightning or switching surge voltages. The international standards for SPDs are now widely spread and make the new generation of AC surge protectors more efficient and more secure. But an important issue is not really described on the standards and even on the related guides for surge protection application: what is the real influence of the AC surge protector on the AC network, especially during their operation? As we know, the Power Quality (PQ) is a key point for the process continuity, the safety and even for the life expectancy of the sensitive devices connected to the AC distribution network: during their operation on surges, the surge protectors could generate some phenomena which could create disturbances or troubles on the AC network. Because the AC surge protectors are from different technologies and because the AC networks could have several configurations, many cases are possible, even the worse... Market analysis shows sometimes a low confidence of the end user in the surge protection, not because he thinks it is not efficient, but because he supposes the use of SPD could bring extra disturbances on his installation. For this reason, an in depth information about the real interaction would be useful.},

This paper describes the development of the second part of the project: the interconnection of the core with a source of information: a camera network. In order to avoid congestion or loss of data packets, thinking of non-optical fiber networks, speed reports will be sent to the RIMAC core instead of unprocessed images. In situ, at each camera node, speed calculation is done using a C++ computer vision application and the OpenCV's Libraries over an SBC (Single Board Computer) Raspberry Pi2 with a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) camera. The first testbed was done in a few streets of Lima, an emerging South American city where live about 10 million people.
