  pages={17-21},
  abstract={Among the 17 sustainable development goals specified by United Nations organization in 2015, goal four is the key for progress towards the achievement of all the other goals. However, studies show that this goal is yet to be achieved among African universities in terms of supervision due to inadequate availability of supervisors to their research students. Ambient learning approach promises to address the problem by allowing access to education services like research supervision at anytime, anywhere and anyhow. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to assess its effectiveness towards achieving sustainable development goal four. The aim of this paper is to describe a model that illustrates how ambient learning systems can be combined with decision support tools to support evaluation of its effectiveness.},

  abstract={Approximately 25 years have passed since the "sense-act-think" paradigm was advanced as the operational definition of a robot, and as a broad roadmap for robotics research. With the appearance of mobile robots that do real work in the real world, "communicate" has de facto been added to the list of functionalities that are essential features of robots. In keeping with the theme of the ROSE-2003 Workshop, this paper attempts to articulate and justify a set of intellectual and engineering challenges for 21 st century sensing and perception for robotics. It especially argues for examining the current and re-examining future roles for teleoperation, both as a practical route around the improbability that machine intelligence will equal human intelligence in the foreseeable future, and because it is apparent that sensor improvement is driven in large part by incremental advances in sensor-display design-and-test loops that are in turn driven by human factors governing perception.},

  abstract={As Grid technologies evolve quickly on Internet, research related to resource allocation and task scheduling faces new opportunities and challenges. These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing load balancing-oriented job scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical Grid model structure, following statistical thinking, this paper proposed a new task scheduling and resource allocation algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing within Grid systems. This algorithm consists of three main modules, they are load tracking module, job distributing module and load monitoring module. On the basis of having explained the functions of the different functional parts and the relationships between them, the corresponding pseudo-code algorithm are given. The results of simulative experiments show that the algorithm is effective.},

  abstract={Models of the cognitions used by engineering students to solve problems have always been a part of engineering education. Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.},

Being recognized as a campus with its high employability rate, this paper aims to describe how IT Del develops its computing curriculum in connection to its involvement in the Decart project. This paper first presents the Indonesia curriculum guideline. This is followed by the discussion of the development process of computing curriculum emphasizing three components: knowledge, skills, and dispositions. The last component is believed to be one of the important components aimed to prepare graduates to have 21st century skills. Then we relate them to the involvement of IT Del in the DECART project, funded by Erasmus Mundus. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that our existing curriculum development approach has been successful to build expected graduates' competence. This is expected to give an insight to define an agile curriculum framework to face the VUCA world as one of the objectives for the DECART project.},

Children have demonstrated a big capacity for secure their knowledge if the teaching method is simple and didactic through games and recreational activities. For these reasons, we propose the use of unplugged activities, which do not require the use of computers and has the objective of promoting, clearing out and developing essentials concepts of computer science, as well as developing the computational thinking in kids through a funny and dynamic focus.

  abstract={The application of “programming education” has become one of the future technological trends, and students with design backgrounds should also grasp this important development. In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.},

  abstract={The solution consists in creating a new curriculum for the topics of computing in schools that will focus on a didactic teaching so that students can develop computer thinking. It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.},

  abstract={In the area of testing ICs, once an IC has failed a traditional go/no-go test, it needs to be tested further to determine if it can support error-tolerant operation for one or more high volume customers. This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004). Digital systems designers have almost always focused on the concept of exact computational capability. Error-tolerant VLSI chips are a step in this direction using today's technologies, addressing current computational needs, and accepting present realities of scale and yield.},

  abstract={Although deep learning models are powerful among various applications, most deep learning models are still a black box, lacking verifiability and interpretability, which means the decision-making process that human beings cannot understand. Therefore, how to evaluate deep neural networks with explanations is still an urgent task. In this paper, we first propose a multi-semantic image recognition model, which enables human beings to understand the decision-making process of the neural network. Then, we presents a new evaluation index, which can quantitatively assess the model interpretability. We also comprehensively summarize the semantic information that affects the image classification results in the judgment process of neural networks. Finally, this paper also exhibits the relevant baseline performance with current state-of-the-art deep learning models.},

A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services.

  abstract={This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.},

  abstract={Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.},

  abstract={The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.},

  abstract={The testability of equipment has become the key factor affecting equipment availability, and detracts from readiness and mission success. To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.},

  abstract={Situation assessment in interactions needs to make an explicit evaluation of the social interactions. When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.},

  abstract={Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={With quick upgrading of knowledge and high demand for all-round talents at the age of information, the integration of computer multimedia into college English course has altered traditional teaching model. The teaching focus is converted to learning process from content; teacher becomes the organizer and manager of class, the director and supervisor of students instead of the lecturer; students become active and autonomous learners instead of passive receivers. Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.},

  abstract={Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.},

  abstract={A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.},

  pages={2446-2459},
  abstract={This paper presents a graph processing based traffic estimation system, GPTE, which is able to achieve high accuracy and high scalability to support city scale traffic estimation. GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.},

  year={2016},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.},

  abstract={By thinking of a society as a cognitive system, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for artificial social intelligence. This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

  abstract={Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer.

  abstract={Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.},

  abstract={Granular computing is not only a computing model for computer centered problem solving, but also a thinking model for human centered problem solving. In this paper we have discussed the architecture of granular computing models, strategies, and applications. Especially, comparison on the perspectives of granular computing in various aspects as AI, data mining and phases of software engineering are presented, including requirement specification, system analysis and design, algorithm design, structured programming, software testing. Here we have discovered the mining patterns in the sequence of events has been an area of active research in AI. However, the focus in this body of work is on discovering the rule underlying the generation of a given sequence in order to be able to predict a plausible sequence continuation(the rule to predict what number will come next, given a sequence of numbers). Here we have used the Fuzzy based linear programming problem of Granular computing model for the purpose of mathematical simulation and we have compared it with the different existing algorithms for better performance analysis.},

  abstract={In 2008, Lotfi Zadeh concluded that to make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence a paradigm shift is needed. In previous papers we introduced the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach to get more effective and reliable cognitive, biophysical, and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.},

  abstract={Memory and storage are important elements in consumer electronic devices. They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing. Let's take a look at developments that bring processing and memory/storage together in new ways to enable smarter consumer devices.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.},

  abstract={Computational thinking and coding has received considerable attention over the past several years. Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

  abstract={According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics the job outlook for computer scientists and engineers is stellar for the long term-President Obama and industry leaders encouraged colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year. Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.},

  abstract={No design, no business. Higher test score doesn't represent better global competitiveness. Creativity is central to the competitive capabilities of 21st century citizens and thus creativity education should play crucial role for every grade curricular. However, the development of creative potential requires work and incubation over time. It takes more efforts than standard curricula can afford. What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving--the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors. The process of problem awareness, situation perception, idea generation, solution emergence and selection as well as action preparations are elaborated in the story. Pilot testing of target users show a strong positive attitude toward this digital storybook.},

  pages={132965-132975},
  abstract={Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.},

  abstract={As an important course in computer education in higher education, the programming basic course has problems in teaching and learning. The role of teachers is knowledge imparters. And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved.},

  abstract={This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.},

  abstract={Knowledge based methodology is one of the primary areas of development in engineering problem solving methods for decades. In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded. Following this, process for the definition of coordinated product behaviors and affect propagation in a specific and purposeful change affect zone are explained. Finally, an extended product definition space is explained as medium in integrated product modeling using the proposed method.},

  abstract={As metaphorical representations showed beneficial effects on several parts of computer science, this paper focuses on the question: How can metaphorical representations in VR enhance the understanding of theoretical computer science concepts? A concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.},

  abstract={Many of us write code regularly as part of our scientific activity, perhaps even as a full-time job. But even though we write--and use--more and more code, we rarely think about the roles that this code will have in our research, in our publications, and ultimately in the scientific record. In this article, the author outlines some frequent roles of code in computational science. These roles aren't exclusive; in fact, it's common for a piece of code to have several roles, at the same time or as an evolution over time. Thinking about these roles, ideally before starting to write the code, is a good habit to develop.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-In-Progress paper elucidates the approach of the NSF-funded CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance for creating change in students' competencies by an effort across eight institutions to support the delivery of one-and two-credit hour courses for three levels of problem solving in Computer Science: general problem solving, computational thinking in problem solving, and algorithmic thinking in problem solving. The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.},

  abstract={Creative cognitive systems are rarely assessed with the same tools as human creativity. In this paper, an approach is proposed for building cognitive systems which can solve human creativity tests. The importance of using cognitively viable processes, cognitive knowledge acquisition and organization, and cognitively comparable evaluation when implementing creative problem-solving systems is emphasized. Two case studies of artificial cognitive systems evaluated with human creativity tests are reviewed. A general approach is put forward. The applicability of this general approach to other creativity tests and artificial cognitive systems, together with ways of performing cognitive knowledge acquisition for these systems are then explored.},

  abstract={With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.},

  year={2007},
  volume={54},
  number={6},
  pages={1161-1166},
  abstract={Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks},

  abstract={For many people, writing is a difficult task because finding a good topic and suitable elements is just not an easy job. In this study, we put our focus on narrative creation and propose that a Picture-Attributed-Note (PAN) framework can help with writing job. Picture and attributed notes were used to present and record story elements and to stimulate creativity. The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1]. The results reveal that the PAN system helps stimulate user's creativity and did not change their main creating process. In addition, the user interface of the PAN system could allow the user to concentrate more on the writing creation process.},

  abstract={The widespread usage of wearables set the foundations for many new applications that process the wearable sensor data. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied application that targets to classify the data captured by multiple wearable sensors into one of a predefined set of activity classes. Earlier approaches in the area relied on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, while many researchers proposed solutions based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Convolution Neural Network (CNNs). Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community. This is of paramount importance if we consider that wearables are characterized by scarce memory and computational resources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of the size of the various CNN components (focusing on the convolution and dense layers) to the model validation performance. As a second step, we focus on two CNN models with diverse memory characteristics (the lean and the fat model) and we employ three different compression techniques (Filter-Based Pruning –FBP,– Low Rank Factorization –LRF,– and dynamic range quantization) assuming various compressibility scenarios.},

  abstract={The introduction of Computational Thinking skills at school has mostly been associated with programming skills. In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling.},

  abstract={The fast pace of change in high technology product development requires high flexibility and adaptation in product design and technology management. Within this context, appropriate learning environments are planned to shape future Information and Communication Technology staff in such a way they could get able to keep up with new trends and innovations. A constructivist educational model based on Active Learning represents a step towards this vision for staff training. This paper deals with a new organization of a 13 weeks course based on the inverted class model, where students are introduced to the problem-posing domain by a direct involvement of enterprises, which participate specifically to the problem definition and assessment phases. In the case study shown, students simulate a production business unit in all the phases that characterize the product/service development life cycle. A mixed traditional and company-based organization of the course is supposed to improve students competences by proposing solutions leveraging on appropriate tools taken from traditional experiences and also gaining benefits from a learning-by-doing approach that encourages the use of state-of-the-art solutions. A preliminary study is performed to see how expected professional competences are met during the course, with the additional goal of collecting indications that could help to improve the learning framework for future editions of the course.},

In this paper, we show new, prosperous combination of computational science and new ideas in evolutionary economics and cognitive science offering appealing extensions to traditional game theoretical modelling.

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={150-156},
  abstract={To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.},

  abstract={This Research Work in Progress Paper aims to develop holistic competencies in engineering students through course-level teaching and learning activities. Information is the core of many engineering fields, such as communications engineering, signal processing, and computational intelligence. Despite its ambient existence in our everyday lives, most of the engineering students are not aware of the connection between information and their professional role as an engineer in the informational world. We seek to engage engineering students in understanding their professional and ethical responsibility, and promote their awareness of the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context. Our study is grounded in the intersection between two theoretical frameworks: (1) Holistic Competencies and (2) William Perry’s scheme of intellectual and ethical development. Having students’ learning evidence against William Perry’s framework and identified students’ cognitive changes along their course study, we suggest that holistic competencies can be fostered through cultivating students’ multifaceted understanding of information and supplementing with real cases where social media serve as a channel for students to exchange ideas to address various global challenges.},

  abstract={STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-ematics) education is crucial, rising the demand for technological skills driven by the Industry 4.0 digital transformation, and fostering problem-solving, autonomy, computational thinking, creativity, innovation, and effective teamwork skills. To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics. The project was recognized by the Directorate General of Education of Portugal as a recommended practice of a digital initiative within secondary schools.},

  abstract={Technological trends have evolved, extended and converged in the 21st century. Much of these evolutions are incremental, differential and the aim is to sustain or rise above others amidst a dynamic landscape. As data and knowledge bases extend, the fitness of features in each evolution requires systemic modelling targeting multi-objectives. Identification of the local regions of interest and significant features enable more efficient optimization. The information core, current or new invariant features which proceed to the next iteration coupled with gamification in certain domains, can lead to varying implications. This paper briefly reviews literature on associative networks, case-based reasoning, combinations and permutations, optimization, and gamification and conclude with implications and opportunities for symbiotic networks.},

  abstract={Now with the current state of power engineering, the idea of a microgrid (MG) is widely accepted because of how quickly energy electronics are being made. People are also becoming more interested in direct current (DC) MGs because DC delivery schemes have benefits like less damage and quick alignment of energy loading resources. With the rise of distributed output, a DCMG with many fonts is an important area to investigate. In this DCMG with many sources, the goal is to offer voltage help and strong value division. The control technique includes a thorough analysis of the "state-of-the-art" control procedures in DCMGs. This is important because it makes sure that MG's power and performance are always the same. In this section, the main and secondary control mechanisms in the DCMG hierarchy are explained. In particular, the main ways to control internal loop and droop control are looked at. The secondary regulation is a solution that is centralized, spread out, and independent.},

  abstract={When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.},

  abstract={In order to engage the player, video games are often based on challenges that must be overcome. What are colloquially known as programming games present these challenges as puzzles where computational thinking and coding skills have a fundamental role in successfully overcoming them, even though they are not serious games and have been designed purely as entertainment products. Indeed, algorithm design and coding is the fun part. This paper presents a survey of all such games up to February 2020 published in the Steam digital distribution platform, categorizing them by content covered according to a basic programming curriculum. This study provides some insights on the nature of this kind of games and allows assessing their adequacy as educational tools, broadening the body of knowledge on available games for teaching computational thinking and coding, beyond serious games.},

  title={Formal Concept Analysis of Students’ Solutions on Computational Thinking Game}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a fundamental competence for the 21st century. It refers to a set of capacities and skills that can be stimulated to facilitate the teaching-learning process in a wide range of fields, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Experts in information technology argue that the earlier children are exposed to programming through digital platforms appropriate for their age, the easier it will be for them to assimilate their concepts in the future. This effort should be continued throughout the educational stages of children and youth to increase students' interest in pursuing STEM studies and careers.This paper describes the Scratch4All project promoted by the consortium CASPAE (a Private Social Solidarity Institution) and Inova-Ria, with technical assistance from professors at the public higher education institution Coimbra Institute of Engineering. Scratch4All Project includes the activities Scratch on Road, Programming and Robotics Lab, and the Scratch4All Digital Platform. According to the impact assessment for the school year 2020-2021, the Scratch4All project promotes school success and true equality in access to new technologies for students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary school, developing essential skills for their academic and professional future such as computational thinking, STEM competencies and social skills. By encouraging young girls to participate in technological projects, this project also aims to combat gender stereotypes.},

  abstract={This concept paper suggests a new way of thinking about the origin, growth, and spread of a general-purpose "scientific habit of mind" in humans, and discusses how intelligent coaching agents may help. The argument begins with a description of the role of the cognitive cycle in animal thinking. We then examine critical differences between non-human and human cognition, especially in respect to the crucial and yet problematic role of language and linguistic interaction in the "widening spread and deepening hold" of scientific thinking and discourse in human populations. The paper concludes with a vision of a new kind of open, networked learning community inhabited by human learners, human experts, and intelligent agents, and suggests ways of evaluating the development of scientific thinking within these communities using a combination of social network and semantic space analysis.},

  abstract={Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. Again, the results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},

  pages={0358-0360},
  abstract={Cognitive training is considered as an effective intervention for slowing cognitive decline, however single-domain training programs have shown limited transfer to untrained tasks. Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.},

  abstract={This system proposes a question-answer model to analyze answers given by the users to the open-ended question. For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.},
