  abstract={Educators have attempted to innovate the teaching-learning process through computational tools. Some medical educational applications have been created with Augmented Reality resources. Serious Games are one of these kinds of applications, aiming as purpose education or training tasks for users considering entertainment too. Augmented Reality games require appropriate devices for satisfactory experience, as well a usability evaluation to ensure the application's efficiency. With this in mind, this study presents a systematic review to identify approaches that use Mixed or Augmented Reality games in the teaching-learning process of medical contents, and that execute at least one preliminary evaluation with users. Only six selected studies attend the eligibility criteria. We notice a lack of Mixed or Augmented Reality serious games in many medical areas, such as hematology. This work also verified that the evaluation process of these games no adopts a standard protocol or well-known instruments available in the literature for usability evaluation, revealing an opportunity for new studies.},

For this, a computational model of the cognitive processes around depression is used. The agent application uses the principles of Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy. The effect of the application is studied using software simulation. The simulation shows that a person that responds to REBT therapy develops less cognitive vulnerability than people that are not supported.},

  pages={323-328},
  abstract={Smooth Skinning is still the most popular method for the animation of deformable human and creature characters. It has became almost an industry standard because of its intuitiveness to use and efficiency to compute. However it suffers from a number of problems, such as the collapsing elbow and candywrapper effect. In this paper, we present a new method, which is able to solve these defects with very little extra stretching computations. The advantage of this method is its compatibility with the current animation workflow. The animator can change the skin weight any way they like and therefore it favours creativity. The aim of our method is trying to retain the realism and computational efficiency at the same time. It is suitable for situations, where real time response is necessary, like computer games. A practical implementation in the form of a Maya plug-in is created to demonstrate the viability of the method.},

  abstract={This paper studies the design and implementation of billboard recognition system based on deep learning neural network. Billboard recognition system is based on neural network. The main idea behind the system is to identify billboards by using a set of image features. These functions are used to train neural net-works, so it can also be applied to other applications. What are the benefits of using neural networks? Compared with traditional methods (such as regression analysis and clustering algorithms), neural networks have many advantages because they can provide better results at lower computational cost than these methods. The billboard recognition system is based on neural network. Neural network architecture of billboard recognition system in this paper, we will discuss how to use python programming language to create a neural network for recognizing images and texts. We will also learn how to train neural networks using a back propagation algorithm with an example data set and a 94% accuracy score.},

  abstract={Often, textual data is accompanied by images in an attempt to help the user better understand the content. Drawing inspiration from this, it would be interesting to transform any given text into a digital image collage, an artistic graphic object. To automate the process, we developed a software system that uses Natural Language Processing to summarize large paragraphs of text, retrieves images from databases, and arranges them with a Genetic Algorithm on a digital canvas. Given that certain images may be more important to the user, the software computes emphasis factors for scaling the images in the collage. We performed computational experiments to validate each module of our system and initiated user studies to examine their perception of the collages.},

  abstract={The government of Japan has announced the new ICT policy in June 2010. One of the points of the new policy is to start the 3D motion image content market in order to create new key industries in the near future as 3D motion image content will become most powerful media for CGM (Consumer Generated Media). In order to activate 3D motion image content industries, the development of an effective and simple tool for making 3D motion image content even by non-experienced people, is required. The Digital Movie Director (DMD) developed by the author, is being evolved as such an effective and simple tool. However, the big computational power requirement in making 3D motion image content has prevented DMD from being widely deployed. The cloud computing technology is supposed to solve this problem, thus, in this paper, the future prospects of the 3D motion image content industries with the cloud computing technology will be explained.},

  abstract={In distributed command and control (C2), the primary tool for consistency in operational situational assessment (SA) is the common operational picture(COP) and continuous text updates that define relevant objects, their relationships, and their intent. Context often resides in the warfighterpsilas "conversation," or in manual hand gestures in the battlefield. The primary tactical method for capturing this information resides in text chat and voice communications. There is a primary reliance on text chat (due to its persistence) in hostile tactical environments with little to inform its practice or its improvement. We focus on three areas to improve the ability to communicate SA context by (1) developing a computational approach to acquiring chat SA themes from unstructured text; (2) exploiting the use of icons, images, and symbols in developing an SA language; and (3) prototyping a new technology of inscription with the development of data-generating gloves.},

  abstract={The current study is to determine whether people mentally simulate the movement when they process fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., xiăo ji̅ng zŏu rù se̅n lín “A trail goes to the forest”), which literally include no movement in a space but implicitly entail the motion in our conceptual system. We conducted a depiction task to instruct participants in drawing what they thought when they read fictive motion sentences and non-fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese. After the drawing task, three participants that did not join the drawing task judged whether the trajectory was lengthened or not in the pictures according to their intuition. The experimental results show that trajectories depicted for the fictive motion sentences were judged significantly more lengthened than those for the non-fictive motion sentences. The findings of our study suggest even though there is no explicit movement involving in the meanings of fictive motions in Mandarin, people automatically simulate the movement and the trajectories. This study has practical implication for computational linguistics in analyzing subtle semantic meanings among motion verbs.},

According to the defects lying in mind evolutionary algorithm, the niche technique is developed to improve MEA in this paper. The swarm is classified and reduced the searching zone, which keeps the swarm diversity and to speed up optimization. Based on parameter optimization and tuning for the main steam temperature cascade control systems in power plants with serious parameter uncertainty, multi-disturbance and large delay, the simulation results show that this method has the advantages of fast optimization and low computational complexity; it is very effective for cascade PID parameter optimization and endues main steam temperature control systems with better control qualities and better system robustness.},

  abstract={Studying how intelligence analysts use interaction in visualization systems is an important part of evaluating how well these interactions support analysis needs, like generating insights or performing tasks. Intelligence analysis is inherently a fluid activity involving transitions between mental and interaction states through analytic processes. A gap exists to complement these transitions at micro-analytic level during data exploration or task performance. We propose Behavioural markers (BMs) which are representatives of the action choices that analysts make during their analytical processes as the bridge between human cognition and computation through semantic interaction. A low level semantic action sequence computation technique has been proposed to extract these BMs from captured process log. Our proposed computational technique can supplement the problems of existing qualitative approaches to extract such BMs.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the extensive application of artificial intelligence in various fields, the research on how to apply artificial intelligence to education has gradually become the focus of attention. Knowledge map is a giant semantic network composed of nodes and edges, which represents the semantic association between different nodes in the form of large-scale graph. Knowledge map, as a structured storage form of multi-domain data in the real world, provides semantic relevance between data and makes it possible for artificial intelligence to make better use of data. The research of representation learning based on knowledge map realizes the distributed representation of entities and relationships, significantly improves the computational efficiency, effectively alleviates the problem of data sparseness and can realize the fusion of heterogeneous information, which is of great significance for people to obtain effective information from massive data. In view of the above situation, taking WebQA data set as an example, this paper proposes a method to simplify the original text, introduce apriori knowledge related to answers from the knowledge map, and use neural network model to generate Chinese questions. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the difficulty of model training and improve the quality of model problems.},

  abstract={Openflow provides a key step in abstracting network functions by separating the control and the forwarding plane. However, current rather rigid switches constrain packet processing programmability. It is therefore complex to implement flexible packet classification within existing ASIC-based switches, especially when forwarding switches rely on a restricted set of tables. In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism for assigning rule entries to switch tables. Accordingly, we propose a conceptual abstraction that tailors Openflow forwarding paths to the hardware switch. Our approach aims to provide an optimal mapping of entries to physical tables. Its main idea consists in using a semantic analysis to reflect the computational relation between rules and a set of packet descriptors characterized by predefined table entries.},

From the perspective of the overall process of the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the design expression of the modern creativity, Chinese traditional handicrafts still have great research value in the process of promoting the expression of the modern creative design. The existing creative design expression methods have the problems of high feature dimensions, large computational overhead or relatively low detection rate and so on. In this paper, a kind of traditional Chinese handicrafts that promote the expression of the modern creative design based on the computer multimedia technology is put forward. This method is aimed at the modern creative processing of the traditional Chinese handicrafts, using the computer multimedia technology to process the traditional Chinese handicrafts. The experimental results show that this method has relatively low time complexity and high detection rate than those of the traditional methods. In addition, it has relatively good robustness for the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the expression of the modern creative design.},

  abstract={Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.},

  abstract={Summary form only for tutorial. Measuring systems and instruments are becoming more and more complex and are presently capable of performing advanced measurement operations. The recent developments in sensor technology, analog-to-digital converters, and computational capabilities of DSP devices, and the relative simplicity with which these components can be interconnected have opened new possibilities to measurement science and practice. These developments are revealing a number of new issues involving the very fundamentals of the measurement science, from the definition of a new measurement paradigm to the metrological characterization of the measured results. This tutorial is therefore aimed at reconsidering these basic issues, having in mind their application to the modern measuring systems. A model of the measurement process, as a bridge between the empirical world and the world of knowledge and abstract concepts, will be presented. Within this model, the measurement process is only capable of providing incomplete knowledge (the measurement result) about the measurand. It will be shown how an incomplete knowledge about the measurand is still acceptable, provided that we are capable of estimating how incomplete this knowledge is. Starting from this consideration, the methods for characterizing the result of a measurement will be discussed, focusing mainly on the uncertainty, calibration, and traceability concepts. A short survey on the International Metrology Organizations will be also given. After having introduced the basic concept of metrology, a basic instrument diagram will be introduced, and the diagram of the modern systems based on digital signal processing techniques will be discussed in deeper details.},

  abstract={It has been reported that human thoughts processes of sensory-motor functions as well as high level of cognitive processes may be highly reproducible between multiple trials as measured via functional MRI data. This trend of the reproducibility seems consistent between multiple subjects as well. We have also presented in our earlier study that six distinct thought processes were shown highly consistent spatial patterns of activations as evaluated from automated classification performance. In the present study, this automated classification performance was compared depending on the feature vector selection methods. A general linear model (GLM) was adopted to define a neuronal activity and voxel-based or atlas-based approaches were adopted as feature vector selection methods. The classification results showed superior performance from the voxel-based feature selection method than the atlas-based method. Nonetheless, when multiple atlases were used to defined feature vector elements, the resulting performance was comparable to that of the voxel-based method with greatly reduced computational time.},

The ability of self-diagnosis is achieved in the automated line by incorporating a computational intelligence tool like fuzzy logic. The decision support model proposed here provides intelligent decisive signals similar to the fuzzy capability of human brain. Fuzzy Logic control (FLC) model is designed to recognize the events that are likely to create defects and output action signals are generated. Speed difference between conveyor rollers and rolled products, percentage of carbon content and impact force on groove rollers are the three inputs and it produces two outputs in the form of either Andon (a visual signal) or line stoppage. By using Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) autonomation system, surface defects can be prevented by monitoring level of inputs.},

  abstract={Dramatic developments in localization techniques have been achieved recently to overcome the difficulties of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The diversity of IoT in nearly all sectors, which requires the connection among objects, makes localization an important aspect in the field as it adds to the features of IoT. Precisely estimating the position of an object is one of the main purposes of localization to facilitate the exchange of information among the objects. The aim of this work is to explore the existing localization techniques and to evaluate existing encapsulating classification systems. For the literature survey, we have searched in all major databases. Relevant papers (amongst more than hundreds of the papers) are considered and evaluated to contribute to this work. In conclusion, the presented survey will assist people who are working in the field of localization in IoT and different related methods.},

  pages={464-473 Vol. 1},
  abstract={Recent technological advances have made it possible to support long lifetime and large volume streaming data transmissions in sensor networks. A major challenge is to maximize the lifetime of battery-powered sensors to support such transmissions. Battery, as the power provider of the sensors, therefore emerges as the key factor for achieving high performance in such applications. Recent study in battery technology reveals that the behavior of battery discharging is more complex than we used to think. Battery powered sensors might waste a huge amount of energy if we do not carefully schedule and budget their discharging. In this paper we study the effect of battery behavior on routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks. We first give an on-line computable energy model to mathematically model battery discharge behavior. We show that the model can capture and describe battery behavior accurately at low computational complexity and thus is suitable for on-line battery capacity computation. Based on this battery model we then present a battery-aware routing (BAR) protocol to schedule the routing in wireless sensor networks. The routing protocol is sensitive to the battery status of routing nodes and avoids energy loss. We use the battery data from actual sensors to evaluate the performance of our protocol. The results show that the battery-aware protocol proposed in this paper performs well and can save a significant amount of energy compared to existing routing protocols for streaming data transmissions. The network lifetime is also prolonged with maximum data throughput. As far as we know; this is the first work considering battery-awareness with an accurate analytical on-line computable battery model in sensor network routing. We believe our battery model can be used to explore other energy efficient schemes for wireless networks as well.},

  year={2015},
  volume={12},

  pages={1013-1017},
  abstract={Is it possible to use stereo images to generate point clouds and to compute rigorous uncertainty maps? Currently, neither modern commercial photogrammetric software nor state-of-the-art algorithms are able to provide a spatial distribution of uncertainty. In this letter, we explain why this is the case, despite a high demand from the user community. Many applications would indeed benefit from the availability of error bars on each point, as uncertainties on derived models and quantities could be accurately predicted. For instance, change detection could be performed rigorously since the statistical significance of observed changes could be computed. In this letter, we focus on dense stereo methods. We first explain that it is not possible to derive reliable predictive uncertainties mainly due to matching and modeling errors. Our research shows that both intrinsic and practical limitations of the algorithms lead to unpredictable artifacts. Then, we focus on the use of empirical errors, showing that, despite the redundancy brought by multiview stereo, there is a fundamental limitation due to the unknown density of independent measurements. We think that these problems will represent a big challenge for the future, as these limitations cannot be addressed by algorithmic design, computational power, or imaging sensor technology.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={7041-7050},
  abstract={In precision livestock farming, the individual identification of cattle is crucial to inform the decisions made to enhance animal welfare, health, and productivity. In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag’s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Recently, the interest in robots capable of experiencing empathy and displaying emotions has grown. This trend can be attributed to the pervasive presence of robots in many environments, such as homes, offices, museums, and hospitals, that require more empathic and reliable human-machine relationships. Recent studies demonstrated that providing the robot with the ability to think aloud improves humans’ trust in machines, as they can understand the underlying reasoning of the artifact, what conclusions it can draw, and why and how. This work integrates a robot’s inner speech mechanism with Damasio’s theory of emotions to make the robot functionally conscious of its emotional experience, leading to a computational model of Extended Consciousness, SUSAN (Self-dialogue Utility in Simulating Artificial Emotions). Damasio claims that emotions originate within the body and precede and influence the reasoning processes that make the person aware of them. According to his theory, Extended Consciousness refers to the humans’ cognitive processes that make the humans themselves aware of the physiological experiences of emotions purged by an external stimulus. SUSAN models the bodily emotional experience and simulates the awareness of the emergent emotion by using inner speech. The model is presented, and the initial results related to a use case are discussed.},

  abstract={The ability to recognize emotion is one of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence, an aspect of human intelligence that has been argued to be even more important than mathematical and verbal intelligences. This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

  year={2007},
  volume={37},

  pages={547-561},
  abstract={An enduring characteristic of emergencies is the need for near-simultaneous development and deployment of new management procedures. This need can arise with the onset of highly novel problems and the need to act quickly-factors that reduce opportunities for extensive planning in managing the emergency. As a result, decision makers in emergencies must be prepared to improvise. By understanding the cognitive processes in improvisation, organizations can better learn how to plan for, manage, and learn from improvised action. To help create this understanding, this paper reviews and synthesizes prior results on improvisation in the art of jazz, exploring how these results may be applied to improvisation in emergency management. A theory of improvisation in emergency management is then developed and expressed as a cognitive model. The modelpsilas implementation in computer-executable code is then reviewed, along with an illustration of how the model improvises in an emergency situation. Finally, implications of this model and opportunities for future research are presented.},

SC is causing a paradigm shift in engineering and science fields since it can solve problems that have not been able to be solved by traditional analytic methods. In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation, flexible knowledge acquisition, and flexible knowledge processing, which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use of SC.

  pages={393-407},
  abstract={The notion of the necessary criticality (both with respect to path and to activity) of a network with imprecisely defined (by means of intervals or fuzzy intervals) activity duration times is introduced and analyzed. It is shown, in the interval case, that both the problem of asserting whether a given path is necessarily critical and the problem of determining an arbitrary necessarily critical path (more exactly, a subnetwork covering all the necessarily critical paths) are easy. The corresponding solution algorithms are proposed. However, the problem of evaluating whether a given activity is necessarily critical does not seem to be so easy. Certain conditions are formulated which, in some situations (but not in all possible situations), allow the necessary criticality of activities to be evaluated. The results obtained for networks with interval activity duration times are generalized to the case of networks with fuzzy activity duration times. Two effective algorithms for calculating the degree of necessary criticality of a fixed path, as well as an algorithm for determining the paths that are necessarily critical to the maximum degree, are proposed.},

The goal of this competition was to set a common platform for evaluation of the recent development in sclera segmentation and also to attract the attention of researchers to this new area. In this regard, we have prepared a Multi-Angle Sclera Dataset (MASD) version 1. It is comprised of 2624 RGB images taken from both the eyes of 82 identities. In other words, it consists of images of 164 (82*2) different eyes. Moreover, we have prepared manual segmentation masks of these images to create the baseline. We have, furthermore, adopted precision and recall-based statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness and the ranks of the competing algorithms. To summarize, ten participants registered for the competition, and among them four participants submitted their algorithms/ systems. The results achieved by these algorithms reflect noteworthy developments in the literature of sclera segmentation employing cutting edge segmentation techniques. Along with the algorithm of the four competing teams and their results, the MASD version 1 dataset will also be freely available for research purposes from the organizer's website.},

  abstract={Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (Chat-GPT) and related Generative AI models are leading a paradigm shift in the acceptance and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all disciplines and industry sectors. Despite the criticisms of an ‘intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth’, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.},

  pages={593-608},
  abstract={This paper presents a model metrics and a methodology for evaluating the critical path on the data flow execution graph (DFEG) of multimedia algorithms specified as C programs. The paper describes an efficient dynamic critical path evaluation approach that generates no explicit execution graph. Such approach includes two key stages: 1) the instrumentation of the C code and the mapping into a C++ code version and 2) the execution of the C++ code under real input data and finally the actual dynamic evaluation of the critical path. The model metrics and the software analysis methodologies aim at the estimation and at the increase of the upper bound of execution speed and parallelization potential. Both metrics and methodology are particularly tailored for application with complex multimedia algorithms. Critical path analysis and the subsequent algorithmic development stage is a fundamental methodological preliminary step for the efficient definition of architectures when the objective is the implementation of the multimedia algorithm on systems-on-chips or heterogeneous platforms.},

  abstract={In this paper, we report our first experiment in teaching the theory of computability in the problem-based way. As far as we know, this is the first experiment of applying the problem-based method to a purely theoretical course of computer science. Performing the course consisted of three parts: First, the new subjects were learnt according to the classical seven step method, which contains both individual and group work, and problem reports were written. Second, the students participated in a traditional exercise session, in which the new techniques were practised in details. And third, the students kept a learning diary, in which they processed the subjects further, tried to construct an overall schema of things learnt, and supervised their own learning. The results were really successful: the students committed themselves well and the drop out percentage was very small; they achieved very deep understanding of the subjects measured by their grades and quality of learning diaries; the experience was enjoyable for both the students and the teachers; and finally, the method supported different kinds of learners very well.},

  year={2010},

  pages={793-798},
  abstract={To exploit the benefits of throughput-optimized processors such as GPUs, applications need to be redesigned to achieve performance and efficiency. In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel. Another contribution of the paper is a critical graph analysis technique to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo based SSTA, leading to 2-9X further speedup.},

  abstract={Pictorial visualizations portray data with figurative messages and approximate the audience to the visualization. Previous research on pictorial visualizations has developed authoring tools or generation systems, but their methods are restricted to specific visualization types and templates. Instead, we propose to augment pictorial visualization authoring with visual style transfer, enabling a more extensible approach to visualization design. To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.},

  abstract={Can computers overcome human capabilities? This is a paradoxical and controversial question, particularly because there are many hidden assumptions. This article focuses on that issue putting on evidence some misconception related to future generations of machines and the understanding of the brain. It will discuss to what extent computers might reach human capabilities, and how it would be possible only if the computer is a conscious machine. However, it will be shown that if the computer is conscious, an interference process due to consciousness would affect the information processing of the system. Therefore, it might be possible to make conscious machines to overcome human capabilities, which will have similar limitations than humans. In other words, trying to overcome human capabilities with computers implies the paradoxical conclusion that a computer will never overcome human capabilities at all, or if the computer does, it should not be considered as a computer anymore.},

  abstract={Power system state estimation (SE) plays a crucial role in the success of advanced tools employed for power system analysis and control in Energy Management Systems. SE is responsible for providing a consistent real-time dataset, free from errors that may compromise decision-making and put the system at risk. The presence of criticalities involving elements such as network branches, measuring units or measurements may impose difficulties for the detection/identification of gross errors in the acquired data. The simultaneous unavailability of the elements that form a given criticality makes the grid unobservable. This paper presents a flexible and effective network-based methodology for the integrated identification of critical groups of branches, measurements and measuring units in SE. The proposed algorithms are constructed, having the properties of such criticalities as their central pillar. Tests performed with IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus benchmark systems are presented, and the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The interplay between pairs of critical factors such as performance, energy and reliability within modern computing systems has always been an interesting topic of study. However, studying the interplay of all three factors together in a many-core, multi-layer design setting has been a relatively recent undertaking. This work explores the practical problems encountered in such studies and introduces the modelling framework ArchOn, which is based on a novel resource-driven graph representation. ArchOn facilitates the analysis and potentially design and synthesis of systems whose design domains are more conveniently organized into multiple layers or levels (e.g. application, OS, hardware, etc.) and potentially large scale and diverse types of concurrency. The layer-agnostic formalism helps designers reason about cross-layer issues and the resource-driven approach is advantageous for reasoning about such issues as energy and time. Example single- and multi-core case studies help explain and illustrate the method.},

  abstract={The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.},

  pages={1780-1785},
  abstract={This paper reports on a pilot study of using ChatGPT, a language model based on GPT-3.5 architecture, for automatic generation of metamorphic relations (MRs), in the context of testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications and limitations of using ChatGPT for MR generation and provide recommendations for future research. Our study contributes to the advancement of automated testing of ADSs, which is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={The impact of process variations increases as technology scales to nanometer region. Under large process variations, the path and arc/node criticality provide effective metrics in guiding circuit optimization. To facilitate the criticality computation considering the correlation, the authors define the critical region for the path and arc/node in a timing graph, and propose an efficient method to compute the criticality for paths and arcs/nodes simultaneously by a single breadth-first graph traversal during the backward propagation. Instead of choosing a set of paths for analysis prematurely, we develop a new property of the path criticality to prune those paths with low criticality at very earlier stages, so that our path criticality computation method has linear complexity with respect of the timing edges in a timing graph. To improve the computation accuracy, cutset and path criticality properties are exploited to calibrate the computation results. The experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that our criticality computation method can achieve high accuracy with fast speed},

  abstract={Edge Intelligence (EI) based collaborative learning approaches have been researched in the recent years by several researchers. As majority of existing collaborative learning approaches are designed in the context of servers, design and development of novel systems are required in order to apply collaborative learning in resource constrained devices. Researchers possess different interpretations of the existing collaborative learning approaches. This paper presents an analysis of the existing work conducted on collaborative learning approaches on the domain of EI. The strongholds and drawbacks of the existing work will be analyzed to identify an ideal collaborative learning approach to be applied on the Internet of things (IoT) edge. The analysis will further include an investigation into the future enhancements and research gaps. The partitioned model training approach has been identified as the most ideal approach for the IoT edge based on the conducted critical analysis process. The reduction of communication overhead in the partitioned model training approach and the application of the partitioned model training approach in other unexplored deep learning model architectures have been identified as future research directions. This paper is a work in progress section of an ongoing research and in the future the findings will be used to design a system to apply the collaborative learning approach in IoT Edge and bridge the existing research gaps.},

  year={2011},

  pages={446-451},
  abstract={Recently, audio concepts emerged as a useful building block in multimodal video retrieval systems. Information like "this file contains laughter", "this file contains engine sounds" or "this file contains slow music" can significantly improve purely visual based retrieval. The weak point of current approaches to audio concept detection is that they heavily rely on human annotators. In most approaches, audio material is manually inspected to identify relevant concepts. Then instances that contain examples of relevant concepts are selected -- again manually -- and used to train concept detectors. This approach comes with two major disadvantages: (1) it leads to rather abstract audio concepts that hardly cover the audio domain at hand and (2) the way human annotators identify audio concepts likely differs from the way a computer algorithm clusters audio data -- introducing additional noise in training data. This paper explores whether unsupervized audio segementation systems can be used to identify useful audio concepts by analyzing training data automatically and whether these audio concepts can be used for multimedia document classification and retrieval. A modified version of the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) speaker diarization system finds segments in an audio track that have similar perceptual properties and groups these segments. This article provides an in-depth analysis on the statistic properties of similar acoustic segments identified by the diarization system in a predefined document set and the theoretical fitness of this approach to discern one document class from another.},

  abstract={This paper describes the use of different and complementary teaching tools on two consecutive courses on Soil Mechanics (on an integrated master in Civil Engineering). In these courses, project-based learning with collaborative or cooperative teamwork was implemented. The teaching tools adopted and described herein include text processors, spreadsheets and presentations, as well as specialized geotechnical software. The students' perceptions were collected using a questionnaire and the impact of those different tools on the students' perceptions are analysed. Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes. Getting students on board, by discussing the aims of using specific strategies, is key to promote academic success. Therefore, students must be the centre of all the teaching and learning processes.},

Data capitalism has significant implications not only in our everyday life and business, but also on the instruments that we employ to understand the world and to achieve value. The data-based society needs complex information technology to process information, to observe, to map, to extract, to put together streams of data which eventually are leading to decision making and to value creation, including - but not limited to - financial value. Big data applications gather data from heterogeneous activity fields and seek to create insights through their cross-sectional interpretation. How are young tech-oriented people equipped to navigate the data-storm that this global current of digitalization and automation is creating? We will look at the case of Innovation Labs tech accelerator, by analyzing the last four editions of the program in terms of working with (big) data.},

  abstract={Maker education for entrepreneurship and innovation is an important mission of China universities. However, current maker education in China universities has the limitations of closed innovation, efficiency-driven, focal product, specialized organization, and so on. This failed to meet makers' demands for real-time awareness of space, adaptive automatic resources, diverse innovation activities and tools with intelligent support in makerspace. Therefore, the innovation ecosystem has emerged to be the best choice to solve those problems. This paper first analyses fundamental principles and elements of innovation ecosystem, and then discusses essentials and properties of innovation ecosystem-oriented maker(IEOM) education. After that, the model of IEOM education by smart technologies is developed, including innovation subject, innovation activity, and innovation environment. Innovative subjects include experiencers, innovators, researchers and experts. Innovation activities are created by the innovation subjects including interest, research, practice and smart creation. The innovation environment is a creation scenario reflecting innovative subjects' rich creation in participating in innovation activities.},

  abstract={The motivation for this work stems from the falling enrollments in the computing discipline and the subsequent challenge to present the study of computing in a manner that is attractive to a wider range of potential students. This paper seeks to capture a new notion of "curriculum models" and to draw attention to the range of possible approaches programs might adopt. This paper addresses issues that may underpin some of this transformational process. It mentions some of the underlying assumptions regarding the situation and explores the affect of curricula reports in computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information technology, and software engineering as published by ACM and the computer society of IEEE. (Both authors have co-authored some of these documents.) From these reports, the paper explores the framework of new curricula models based on broad strategies for creating or developing a curriculum from organization and orientation points of view. Considerations for these new models would include not only topic areas, but also contrasts between traditional and novel approaches. While the paper addresses some structural models, it also explores integrative approaches such as absorption and separatist models as well as modular frameworks and negotiated programs. This topic is very timely and appropriate given the current crisis facing computing education today.},

  abstract={In March 2020, due to the pandemic linked to the COVID-19 virus spreading, all in-person teaching activities planned at the University of Salerno were suspended. This sudden suspension has forced the academic world to rethink in a short time the didactics and to modify teaching styles and approaches, especially in those courses in which laboratory activities were planned. This article will be presented the experiences made in the Computer Networks and Protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) course. The course includes a significant laboratory component where students must put into practice what they learned during the theoretical lessons. In particular, the laboratory exercises involve using specific equipment and devices that can build digital ecosystems for the control and management of well-defined operational contexts difficult to reproduce virtually. Therefore, to give continuity to the didactic activity, it was necessary to redesign the entire exercise system preserving the original educational objectives.},

  pages={57-69},
  abstract={This article reinterprets algorithmic rationality by looking at the interaction between mathematical logic, mechanized reasoning, and, later, computing in the Russian Imperial and Soviet contexts to offer a history of the algorithm as a mathematical object bridging the inner and outer worlds, a humanistic vision that we, following logician Vladimir Uspensky, call the “culture of the impossible.” We unfold the deep roots of this vision as embodied in scientific intelligentsia. In Part I, we examine continuities between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century discussions of poznaniye—an epistemic orientation towards the process of knowledge acquisition—and the postwar rise of the Soviet school of mathematical logic. Establishing this connection allows us to explain, in Part II, the role of the algorithm in disciplinary dynamics between mathematical logic and cybernetics and a characteristic understanding of programming, not as a narrow skill, but as a matter of consciousness.},

  abstract={This article proposes to examine the rise of intensive digitization and technification processes in daily life and the concomitant loss of former historically dominant premachine modes of existence and communication. We shed fresh light on the subject by conducting a historico-philosophical analysis of the evolution of the concept of the machine. The relation between technology and society is investigated in depth through the prism of culture in the latter and the concept of the machine in the former. The evolution of the technosphere is viewed as a series of mutations in the ontological structure of the machine, moving from the equipmental mode of the mechanical tool and ending up with the intelligent machine then the rhizomatic mode of machinic production. Our approach is multidisciplinary, drawing from several traditions, including science, sociology, the philosophy of technology, ontology, and history.},

  abstract={This Cloud Computing is the emerging trend in distributed computing that encourages researchers to investigate its pros and cons for executing scientific workflows. Scheduling of applications modeled as workflows and executed in high performance distributed computing environments like cloud is a computationally hard multi-objective optimization problem. However, it presents various challenges that need to be addressed in order to efficiently utilize cloud resources for workflow applications. In this paper, the authors have critically analyzed the workflow scheduling algorithms for its pros and cons and thereby identified the research issues in workflow scheduling algorithms. The theoretical analysis of `Enhanced Max-Min' scheduling algorithm suggests that if the algorithm is applied for workflow execution in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud, a higher efficiency/lower `makespan' can be achieved if the characteristics of resources are considered while scheduling workflow tasks. Hence the authors have also proposed an extension of `Enhanced Max-Min' algorithm for workflow execution that considers characteristics of resources and `makespan' minimization as a scheduling parameter.},

While it is already well-established in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to the IT field, its impact on the design professions remains relatively unexplored. This essay explores the use of neural networks in architecture, which is arguably the first genuinely 21st-century design technique and discusses experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate unexplored futuristic possible noble forms in architecture. In this way this paper also raises the question if machine can generate noble forms through its creative data optimization process. In this process one of the most famous heritages building of Bangladesh 60 dome mosque (Shat Gombuj Moshjid) has been examined to get expected result. Furthermore, this paper discusses how AI can be used as a personalized tool for architects to generate and express design ideas. It evaluates popular datasets for architectural purposes and considers the potential outcomes of experiments. The input of AI in the design process could usher in a new era of architectural design. As data continues to grow, it is shaping our collective future. Therefore, this paper concludes that it is essential to prepare our trained datasets to accept the future which might open up an extraordinary new chapter in the architectural realm.},

  abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has been linked with significant deterioration of neuro-cognitive health. The forced abnormal isolation mandated by the lockdown has been associated with increased internal stressors, leading to early onset of mental health degeneration. The current challenge for the medical practitioners is to identify tools to help slow down such neurocognitive decline. In this project, we develop a model of sentiment manipulation using linguistic cues that can regulate the affective-motivational state of an individual to reduce triggers of neurocognitive degeneration. Based on the model insights, we build a user-friendly, low-cost Web App, customizable in many languages, to identify and score the primary sentiment of any audio or text to help reduce exposure to content that can potentially trigger internal stressors. In a randomized control experiment with 160 subjects, we find that participants in our target group who consumed content with positive or upbeat cues over a period of 60 days were 3.68 times less likely to report loneliness, 2.1 times less likely to report depressive thoughts and emotions and 1.75 times less likely to report forgetfulness than our control group, providing promising evidence of the potential of positive linguistic cues to prevent or slow down neuro-cognitive degeneration.},

  abstract={Motivated learning is a new machine learning approach that extends reinforcement learning idea to dynamically changing, and highly structured environments. In this approach a machine is capable of defining its own objectives and learns to satisfy them though an internal reward system. The machine is forced to explore the environment in response to externally applied negative (pain) signals that it must minimize. In doing so, it discovers relationships between objects observed through its sensory inputs and actions it performs on the observed objects. Observed concepts are not predefined but are emerging as a result of successful operations. For the optimum development of concepts and related skills, the machine operates in the protective environment that gradually increases its complexity. Simulation illustrates the advantage of this gradual increase in environment complexity for machine development. Comparison to reinforcement learning indicates weakness of the later method in learning proper behavior, even in such protective environments with gradually increasing complexity. The method shows how mental development stimulates learning of new concepts and at the same time benefits from this learning. Thus the method addresses a well know problem of merging connectionist (bottom-up) and symbolic (top down) approaches for intelligent autonomous machine operation in developmental robotics.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Sri Lanka has taken the initiative through its new education reforms to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a compulsory content in the ICT curriculum of lower secondary education from 2025. This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants’ interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.},

  abstract={Cognitive Science is a complex mechanism of solving a problem based on the impact of behavior, analysis of interpretation, studying mental representations functioning of the neurons at the level of brain, perceiving and sensing an object: a living: nature & nurture, a deeper understanding of psychological aspects, relating mind to the brain, handling emotional sense with Intelligent quotient, a meta-analysis study of automation, handling the issues dealing with biasedness due to lack of optimal Hypothesis, correlating to develop ontological representations and illustrating the language of thought on empirical evidence, observational phenomena and applying technologies of Deep learning, machine learning, statistics subset to Artificial Intelligence for optimality. This comprehensive literature study navigates through the historical evolution and interdisciplinary dimensions of cognitive science, spanning from ancient Greek philosophy to its contemporary amalgamation with neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Examining theoretical paradigms like formal logic, rules, concepts, analogies, images, and connectionism, the study elucidates their pivotal roles in deciphering the mind's intricate representations and computations. Focused on the challenges encountered by cognitive science, the study underscores the integration of analytics, foundational concepts, and diverse methodologies such as statistical tools, machine learning, and prescriptive analytics. A Structured outlined working procedure showcases the application of cognitive science principles to enhance student performance, conducting and evaluating surveys, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and association rule mining. The methodology progresses systematically from data collection and persona analysis to prediction hypothesis formulation, mismatch analysis, marks prediction, rule-based classification, association rule mining, data analytics, and exploratory data analysis. Signifying the importance of big data, the study recommends cognitive computing concepts for intervention measures, encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy, gaming approaches, and neurological interventions, thereby contributing to the practical implementation of cognitive science in student performance analysis and intervention.},

  abstract={Space permeates our thinking. Every organism must navigate the physical environment to find what it needs. Many organisms reorganize their environment, as illustrated by ant colonies, beaver dams, and cities. Understanding how to make and use tools, as crows and primates do, requires understanding interrelationships between space, shape, and forces. Understanding science, engineering, and mathematics deeply involves spatial thinking. Thus, understanding the repres ent at ions that underlie human thinking about space is one of the most important problems in understanding human cognition more broadly.},

  pages={52412-52428},
  abstract={This work proposes a transformer-based model capable of generating music in its symbolic domain, in a controllable fashion. The ultimate goal of this is to build a system with which people can compose music collaboratively with a computer. Using an NLP model as a base (GPT-2), we take advantage of the similarities across symbolic music representation and written language to build a model capable of conditionally predicting musical sequences. Controllability is achieved without explicit programming for it, and does not require extensive retraining of the model. A study with 939 participants was performed to evaluate this controllability. The results of this suggest the proposed method is indeed effective and can be used to control the generation of music in its symbolic domain. The method itself is flexible to any desired “control”, but this work focuses specifically on the emotion conveyed when one listens to a piece of music.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},

  pages={125679-125695},
  abstract={Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.},

Next, for binary classification problem, we present solving optimal fuzzy granular hyperplane through evolution strategy; the learning algorithm of parameters and the prediction algorithm of instances are also proposed.

  title={Cross-Modality Learning by Exploring Modality Interactions for Emotion Reasoning}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={56634-56648},
  abstract={Even without hearing or seeing individuals, humans are able to determine subtle emotions from a range of indicators and surroundings. However, existing research on emotion recognition is mostly focused on recognizing the emotions of speakers across complete modalities. In real-world situations, emotion reasoning is an interesting field for inferring human emotions from a person’s surroundings when neither the face nor voice can be observed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal approach for predicting emotion from missing one or more modalities based on attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ self-attention for each unimodal representation to extract the dominant features and utilize the compounded paired-modality attention (CPMA) among sets of modalities to identify the context of the considered individual, such as the interplay of modalities, and capture people’s interactions in the video. The proposed model is trained on the Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (MEmoR) dataset, which includes multimedia inputs such as visual, audio, text, and personality. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 50.63% for the primary emotion group and 42.7% for the fine-grained one. According to the results, our proposed model outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of emotion reasoning.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={2660-2673},
  abstract={Recently, various text-to-image generative models have been released, demonstrating their ability to generate high-quality synthesized images from text prompts. Despite these advancements, determining the appropriate text prompts to obtain desired images remains challenging. The quality of the synthesized images heavily depends on the user input, making it difficult to achieve consistent and satisfactory results. This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a more efficient and automated approach to obtaining high-quality synthesized images. The findings indicate that prompt optimization may offer a promising pathway for text-to-image generative models.},

  title={Dielectric Constant of Sand Using TDR and FDR Measurements and Prediction Models}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={40},
  number={10},
  pages={2408-2415},
  abstract={The effects of soil dry density and water content are being examined through experimental time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) methods in correlation with electromagnetic simulations. The infiltration rate (hydraulic conductivity) of water in sand is exceptionally high, resulting in heterogeneous moisture distribution through the soil. The effective dielectric constant of the soil/water/air mixture is dependent on the soil's dry density and moisture content. Both TDR and FDR methods are performed on a coaxial transmission line filled with a soil/water/air mixture. The flow of the water through the soil creates a dynamic situation in which the soil/water/air electrical impedance changes over time. The resulting soil has heterogeneous water content, creating varying electrical impedance values along the length of the coaxial line. The soil compaction, i.e., dense or loose, has significant impact on the heterogeneity of the moisture content through the soil and the dry density of the soil. In each case, the effective dielectric constant is determined from the data collected from TDR and FDR experiments, and the values are compared with the predictions using established empirical models by Topp, Hilhorst, and Hendrickx. With the exception of the data represented as a function of the degree of saturation, the Hendrickx model appears to best represent the measured dielectric constants since it falls within two standard deviations of the measured data. A computer simulation technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used to supplement experimental observations of various soil moisture contents in a coaxial cell. Simulations confirm that the change in the dielectric constant through the soil is a result of the heterogeneous moisture distribution. It was found that the soil moisture content has a major impact on the resulting dielectric constant from measurements or modeling. In the coaxial-cell device, soil moisture migration during the testing period results in a heterogeneous moisture regime and a temporal dielectric constant. This is particularly exaggerated for high-hydraulic-conductivity soils such as sand.},

The presented method is an extension of the actual developed control system of engine, which uses the theory of situational control of complex systems. This control system uses progressive control algorithms. For practical implementation of this control system it is important to think about computational complexity.

  pages={724-737},
  abstract={The application of wide-band gap semiconductors and their integration with other power electronics components (e.g., passives, gate drivers, sensing, thermal management) can meet the growing demand for volume reduction in power electronics systems. The design of such an integrated system is a complex multiphysics problem given the high number of variables to identify, objectives to optimize, and constraints to satisfy. Traditionally, this complex problem is approached subdividing the design in different steps, where in each step, the single components are designed and optimized independently from the others. This might clearly overlook the effect that the design choices of a single subsystem has on other subsystems, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this article, an automated design approach is proposed with the aim of maximizing power density whilst minimizing total losses. As a vessel to investigate the presented optimization workflow, the magnetically coupled interleaved H-bridge topology is chosen as an emblematic example of multivariable design problem. The first step of this approach consists of developing a loss model of the converter, which takes into account components physical dimensions, the temperature dependence, and the circuit parasitics. In the second step, these models are used within a nested optimization procedure in order to estimate the losses for multiple points of load. With the aim of validating both design approach and optimization results, three different optimal solutions have been deeply analyzed with commercial suit, prototyped, and tested. The showed experimental results endorse the adopted design approach confirming the optimality/validity of the manufactured solutions.},

  abstract={In this paper, a checking system for eye lotion instillations of ophthalmology patients is proposed, using a neural network. It first estimates tilt angles of the eye dropper bottle from acceleration values measured by a triaxial sensor. A sequence of such estimated values is next presented to a discrimination model after network learning, and its output value is considered to be a certainty degree indicating whether an eye lotion is applied at the time zone corresponding to the sequence. The final judgement for the instillation is made by conducting thresholding of the certainty degree. The proposed method employs either a long short-term memory (LSTM for short) or a bidirectional long short-term memory (B_LSTM for short) to construct the discrimination model. Experimental results using practical data reveal that the B_LSTM-based model achieves favorable metric values compared to the LSTM-based model. In addition, it is explored whether the metric values depend on the interval between the time points when the tilt values are measured.},

  abstract={One from the most difficult tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to analyze poetry, which uses a different genre of language than that considered by computer-based techniques. Therefore, computational analysis is an interesting task when we use NLP in poetry, but it is also challenging. There are a number of researchers that entered this field from NLP and they got promising results using mathematical analysis for poetry, including rhythm analysis. In this paper we focused on providing solution for automating the rhythm detection of the Arabic poems and finding the number of rhythm for each verse in poem and the total percentage for each rhythm in all verses of poem, additional to other characteristics for the Arabic poem like percentage of mobile letter in Arabic “harf mutaharrik”, and The quiescent letter, in Arabic “harf sakin”, In spite of the number of studies in the computational analysis of poetry, we think it needs more, not only to make a better understanding of domain but also in developing applications, considering different literary tastes and the psychological effects, to give a recommendation to the readers and in plagiarism detection[1].},

  pages={87-91},
  abstract={With the rapid development of DNA microarray technology, the application of informatics research methods in oncology is becoming more and more popular. Because the gene expression data extraction experiment has the characteristics of a large number of genes and complex and changeable experimental conditions, clustering technology has been introduced into the field of molecular biology to assist research and analyze gene expression data. Currently, many clustering algorithms are applied in gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, owing to the high dimensionality of gene expression data, many algorithms face the problem of low computational efficiency. The method based on the graph theory thinks of the sample of gene expression data as the point in high-dimensional space. Its low sample performance determines that the constructed matrix is small in size. Therefore, it has lower computational complexity. Therefore, the graph regularized non-negative matrices factorization (GNMF) proposed by Cai et al. has been widely used for gene clustering. However, the deficiency of the GNMF algorithm is unstable with data variation for gene clustering. In this paper, we propose post-processing of Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm for Gene Clustering, called pGNMF. In the pGNMF method, we first normalize the solution of GNMF, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the traditional GNMF method to the prior selection of genes or initial conditions, and effectively improving the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing GNMF algorithms for gene clustering.},

Drawing on applied linguistics, computational analysis, text, and discourse inquiry, we unravel the portrayal of characters’ thoughts/mental events through three categories of verba sentiendi: Thoughts and Opinions, Senses and Perceptions, Feelings and Emotions. By quantitatively examining the frequency values and interpreting descriptive statistics data, we shed light on the psychological dimensions that underlie Lessing’s fictional tapestry. Using cutting-edge tools such as Voyant and R/R Studio, we process vast volumes of textual data to quantify the prevalence of verba sentiendi across different categories, offering insights into their quantitative significance. Descriptive statistics provide further nuance by revealing central tendencies, variations, and quartiles within the three main categories under study.},

  abstract={Network Exchange Objects (NEO) is a new software framework designed to facilitate development of complex natural or built distributed system models, where the system model is represented as a graph, through which currencies (e.g., coding information) flux. This paper introduces "system-level hypothesis (SLH) testing" as a form of computational thinking that will drive integration of computational and empirical sciences to promote efficient, self- correcting inquiry into the operations and behavior of complex systems. To demonstrate NEO, we examine the problem of maximizing the productivity of a software development organization by measuring growth in the total lines of code (LOC) contributed by developers. We develop a software framework (NEO) that allows rapid creation of model variants representing alternative SLHs. NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as "complex adaptive hierarchical networks" (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). Modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime. Thus, NEO is a simulation framework that can be used in any domain of expertise, where systems are represented as interdependent entities that store and flux multiple currencies.},

  abstract={We began our journey with the goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the remaining billions. We gravitated towards providing neighborhood connectivity in developing and rural regions. Businesses saw an opportunity and local government began to value blanket city-wide coverage. But success was not inevitable. Deployments failed and critics questioned the promises. Perhaps the technology was not ready for prime time. So we began "fixing" the technology, part of which included revisiting governmental policies around spectrum allocation. The US government listened and in a landmark ruling on Nov. 4, the FCC voted to open the unused low frequency bands for unlicensed use. In this talk, the author discussed the evolution of our thinking on how to achieve open pervasive Internet connectivity. The author highlight promising new directions that are full of interesting challenges. The author discussed solutions that researchers are developing and show their trajectory. The author's objective is to present what the author believe is the new frontier of wireless networking and ubiquitous Internet, at the intersection of cognitive systems, mesh networking, and white spaces. The author challenged the audience into taking on new technical problems and thinking about new business models, which will lead us to success in our original goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the masses, bridging the digital divide, and enabling exciting new applications and services in the process.},
