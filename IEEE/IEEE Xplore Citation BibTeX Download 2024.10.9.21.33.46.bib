  abstract={Summary form only given. Empirical Modelling (EM) is an approach to computing which includes, but is much broader than, traditional computer science. It occupies a territory where experience is more prominent than abstractions, where state has priority over pre-conceived behaviours and where the agencies behind state change (human or otherwise) are first identified. Extensive research, and teaching of this approach to final year computer science students, over many years under the leadership of Meurig Beynon at the University of Warwick has resulted in a large body of artefacts, environments and publications. They can be found at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em At the core of EM is an activity we call `making construals'. By a `construal of X' we mean `what we think of X' or `how we make sense of X'. As well as being a personal product of the maker it is at the same time an interactive computer artefact. The development method we adopt allows passage from the mere contemplation of a phenomenon or problem to the crafting of a program-like behaviour that is useful. We shall demonstrate this and explain the advantages of the approach, in at least some domains such as learning, when compared with existing programming paradigms. We have called the approach `human computing' in recognition that its `programs' - in both development and ways of use - have much more of the human qualities of flexibility, and multiple viewpoints, than is usual in a computing environment. It promotes closer collaboration between the human and computer. We shall report on the progress and challenges of the EU Project CONSTRUIT! which is half-way through its three-year duration. With its six European partners CONSTRUIT! seeks to promote the making of construals among teachers and students (at all levels) and to evaluate the effectiveness of this activity for learning across many subjects. See http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em/welcome We hope also to have a practical workshop on making contruals at KST2016 so we look forward to welcoming you to that and seeing what new construals you can help us make!},

  pages={90-94},
  abstract={Technology has an important role in predicting a person's possible risk of chronic disease with the emergence of various kinds of research in the field of medical informatics, especially those related to the four chronic diseases that cause death in Indonesia, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. Delays in medical treatment due to not predicting the disease can lead to other serious complications in the future. Therefore, doctors must think and work harder to assess patients early with factors influencing chronic disease risk. Many studies have carried out disease prediction focused only on one to two disease predictions. Still, research related to risk prediction for four diseases simultaneously has not been carried out in health and medical services. This study makes a risk prediction model for patients suffering from one or four chronic diseases, which goes through several stages in data mining from medical record data and assessments. We used 29 variables from two combination data sources, calculated using the C4.5 algorithm to predict the patient's risk for the disease. Based on the accuracy test results, the chronic disease prediction model has an accuracy value of 84%.This shows that the resulting model has good decision-making and high accuracy. For further research, other parameters can be used to predict disease, such as dietary habits in a certain period.},

  abstract={With the radically increasing workload on web-based systems, new and innovative methodologies have been developed over years to enhance the performance of web caching. Among them are web cache replacement strategies. Although some classifications and categorizations of these strategies have been proposed, there is not yet a methodological and coherent framework for evaluating and comparing their performances. Current benchmarking tools focus on certain factors at the expense of others. In this paper, we survey the existing efforts and attempts; aiming at a unified evaluation framework that can be used to assess various cache replacement strategies in a wider spectrum of scenarios. Such framework can help developers and users to compare and select various replacement strategies to satisfy their needs and constraints. While discussing various issues related to a multitude of cache replacement strategies, we raise some points that we think are worth to consider in developing such a benchmarking tool.},

  abstract={Due to the widespread use of machine learning models in various third-party libraries in languages, such as the sklearn library, people can quickly learn how to simply use machine learning models to empower the projects. However, in many times, most people simply take the model and apply it, never thinking about its generalization ability in the projects where it belongs to, that is, whether the performance of the model will continue to be excellent in different application scenarios and completely different dataset structures. This work mainly tested the generalization ability of two models. By using a dataset for model training, a brand-new dataset is introduced into the trained model to test its generalization ability. If it is found that the generalization ability is not high, our model is optimized to improve its generalization ability as much as possible. After optimization, their generalization ability (represented by precision improvement here, as explained below) has significantly improved, from 38.56% to 100.00% and from 40.24% to 54.79% respectively.},

  pages={6002-6007},
  abstract={Point cloud registration is a fundamental but important technique in robotics and computer vision, such as 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The classical methods used hand-craft features extracted from each point cloud to estimate the rigid transformation between point clouds with iterative closest points (ICP) or its variants. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in object detection, segmentation and registration, especially the well-known work, PointNet, changed how we think about the representation of point clouds. However, the local information is ignored in PointNet as many works pointed out. In this paper, we advise to use graph attention to aggregate local features and a kind of cross attention method for point cloud registration. Firstly, we use a mini-ConvNet to extract point-wise features for sampled points and their neighbors. Then graph attention is applied to aggregate the local information from neighbor points to center points. We consider that previous works which directly estimate the transformation using the features from two point clouds ignore some relationship between the point clouds. Instead, we propose to explore the relation with a kind of cross attention. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={With the development of model driven architecture(MDA), the number of models being used and produced is increasing. Comprehending and reusing models face a real challenge. Model query is put forward to solve these problems. Most people chose using OCL as the query language. However, OCL is a textual query language, it isn't powerful enough and always generates very complex query statements even for a simple query. We think that a graphical representation to specify queries on UML models could facilitate the software developers' comprehension on what a query pattern looks like, because of that it is easier to be understood and much more visual. In this paper, we propose a model query method which is queried by drawing examples of the UML model. This query method is based on the graphical representation we presented in this paper.},

  abstract={With the development of corpus linguistics and the improvement of computer performance, the effect of machine translation is getting better and better, and has been widely used. However, the existing automatic machine translation technology is far from being completely practical. As a feasible alternative to automatic machine translation technology, computer-aided translation technology has been greatly developed, and a feasible mode of computer-aided translation is interactive machine translation technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a Human-Computer Interaction Algorithm(HCIA) and designs an English machine translation system(MTS). Based on the research and analysis of the existing interactive machine translation technology, a human-computer interactive English machine translation algorithm model is proposed; The experimental test and analysis of the English MTS proposed in this paper show that the translation system designed in this paper reduces the translator’s thinking time and cognitive burden, does not need to spend too much time and energy on the correct translation recognition, and improves the translation efficiency.},

Even a low-level, non-academic position at it university may require a security clearance if the work being done is defense related. Out in the "real world", the need to have a clearance is much more commonplace. This is because much government-funded research is dictated by military requirements. Therefore, it is a good idea to think about the potential impact on your job prospects of needing to qualify for a clearance as well as the effect of doing work that is classified on your career development.

  abstract={Scalability is a fundamental problem in the development of computer games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). Players always demand more - more polygons, more physics particles, more interesting AI behavior, more monsters, more simultaneous players and interactions, and larger virtual worlds. Scalability has long been a focus of the database research community. However, the games community has done little to exploit database research. Most game developers think of databases as persistence solutions, designed to store and read game state. But the advantages of database systems go way beyond persistence. Database research has dealt with the beautiful question of efficiently processing declarative languages, and the resulting research questions have touched many areas of computer science. In this talk, I will show how the idea of declarative processing from databases can be applied to computer games and simulations. I will describe our journey from declarative to imperative scripting languages for computer games and simulations, introducing the state-effect pattern, a design pattern that enables developers to design games and simulations that can be programmed imperatively, but processed declaratively. I will then show how we can use database techniques to run scalable games and simulations cheaply in the cloud. I will then discuss how we can use ideas from optimistic concurrency control to scale interactions between players in MMOs, and I will describe how we can use these techniques to build elastic transaction processing infrastructure for the cloud.},

  abstract={We reason about a wide variety of continuous properties. Weight, level, pressure, heat, and temperature are examples of physical quantities. One-dimensional versions of position, force, acceleration, and velocity are also quantities. More abstractly, prices, quality, stability, difficulty, and simplicity are properties that we often think of as more or less continuous. For some quantities, like weight, instruments can measure reasonably accurate numerical values, calibrated upon some well-agreed-on cultural standard. For others, like depth of friendship, it is far from clear that any specific number can be easily measured, although we can often ascertain that we are closer to one person than another.},

  abstract={The main concept of the multilayer client-server queuing network model method is called the basic model. This basic model can be decomposed into two sub-models: client sub-model and server sub-model. These two sub-models can be solved using traditional queuing network analysis method such as MVA algorithm. It is proposed to predict performance of distributed software system based on existed queuing network analysis technique. The client sub-model calculates think time for server sub-model, and the server sub-model calculates waiting time for client sub-model. The overall model can be solved by iteration from one sub-model to the next sub-model. Then the basic model is extended to multiplayer client-server queuing network. This solution for multilayer client-server queuing network is called NLQN.},

  abstract={Intelligence is a multifaceted concept that is generally defined as the ability of comprehending the environment, reasoning, planning, thinking, and learning. The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a well-known measure of cognitive abilities associated with intelligence. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that brain structure and function are related to IQ, which varies from person to person. In this study, we investigated the potential of neuronal effective (directional) connectivity, computed using regression Dynamic Causal Modeling (rDCM) applied to resting-state fMRI data from 100 unrelated subjects in the HCP database, as a source of information for IQ estimation. We used permutation t-test and step-wise wrapper methods to select 24 significant features derived from directional connectivity and applied machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 7-fold cross-validation to predict IQ. The results showed a reasonable IQ estimate, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of about 2 points and a prediction determination coefficient (R2) of about 70 percent. Our findings suggest that neuronal effective connectivity may provide valuable information for IQ estimation and support further investigation into its potential as a biomarker for intelligence.},

  abstract={The main aim of the paper is to establish a simulation environment for inquiry-based learning, in which learners can explore and think possible solutions of stray dogs problems in Taiwan. First, researchers collect related information of stray dogs in Taipei city and use Net Logo to build the model for simulating the both natural and social phenomena (i.e. stray dogs problem). "Agents", including stray dogs, dog-catchers, and animal rescuers, are designed and adjusted on the basis of the collected actual information to make simulation results more meaningful for learning. The main contribution of this study is to allow learners to experience the complexity of the social phenomena and the interaction between associated factors so that they can realize the research process of social science. Although the established model of the simulated learning environment for stray dogs is not very precise, it doesn't affect the design and process of the learning activity. The future research will conduct educational experiments of the designed learning activity with integration of the simulated environment for stray dogs and evaluate learners' cognitive and affective changes before and after the experiments.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problem of grammar and semantic information understanding of the network structure of software system, this paper proposes a method of software defect prediction, which is based on Transformer model, which is completely dependent on self-attention mechanism, it can embed key information in the code semantics of the end-to-end learning software modules. Firstly, the software module is converted into an abstract syntax tree, and later it is traversed to extract word sequence of the software module. Then, thinking of the word sequence as input, acts on the self-attention layer to perform semantic feature embedding of the software module. Finally, the Softmax neural network is used to predict the software defect. The experimental results show that the software defect prediction method based on Transformer model has better defect prediction effects in the three open source software, and it has an average increase of 3.2% than the optimal model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).},

  abstract={The organizational environment increasingly requires that information systems are capable of meeting changing business needs. This situation is evidenced in the general cost profile of systems development where the bulk of spending and effort lies in the (evolutionary) maintenance, integration and interoperability of existing systems. This situation provides a challenge to the generally accepted approaches to systems development and, in response, one stream of thought seeks to divorce business issues from the underlying technology platforms by placing 'models' at the heart of systems development. In principle, model-driven approaches see the system development process as consisting only of models and their transformations. A concern for these approaches is that of providing a structure within which models can be developed at the right level of abstraction and can then be transformed into more concrete models. In fundamental terms, however, model-driven development requires significant thinking in relation to both models and the modeling process.},

In contrast, the evaluation of 3D images and 3D data in digital pathology has not yet reached this level. One of the reasons for this is the resolution of digitized pathological sections, as well as the computing capacity required for the 3D reconstruction model created from them. In the course of our research, we designed and developed a solution that helps overcome difficulties arising from hardware resources with a technique called real-time network video streaming. Our solution enables users to collaboratively visualize 3D medical data even on low computing capacity devices. In the paper, we describe a part of this solution, which refers to the definition of the quality of service indicator. In our research, we implemented several solutions to define quality service in order to provide the best possible result to the user. In the paper, we describe and compare these solutions.},

Graphic models or cartoon-like depictions of an identified body of interest are used to design, to simulate, to test hypotheses and to make predictions. While students are repeatedly exposed to free body diagrams, circuit schematics and other forms of pictorial modeling in their textbooks and lectures, faculty repeatedly complain that students overlook the models and just seek an equation that they think fits the problem situation - a situation characterized as "plugging and chugging". This indicates that students do not fully understand the function these models serve as visual representations of mathematical models and provisional hypotheses of the problem space.

  abstract={Today, we assist to the explosive development of mobile computing devices like PDAs and cellphones, the integration of embedded intelligence (like Web server) in more and more common devices, and the proliferation of wireless communication technologies (IRdA, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS). All these trends contribute to move us closer to the ubiquitous computing world described by Mark Weiser. But while the technology is here, applications, and more important, models and tools for designing future ambient computing systems are still rare. One of the first innovative concepts of ubiquitous computing, context-awareness is still hard to use and understand from a programming perspective. We think that the problem resides in the lack of system support: in traditional computing, operating system offers simple to use and easy to understand abstractions of computational resources. Ubiquitous computing involves an integration of "computing" into the real-world, which is a radically different environment for applications. We think that this environment requires new operating system services and abstractions. Because the real world is made of physical entities, "living" in the physical space, ambient computing software should be able to use abstraction representing such objects, in a simple way. In this paper, we present a light framework to design ubiquitous computing software, called SPREAD. Unlike many approaches which hides too much of the real-world behind traditional computing abstraction, SPREAD defines programming abstraction based on the properties of the physical space. Hence, physical properties, like relative proximity, are used as implicitly in SPREAD as variable addressing in a computer memory. In SPREAD, application (or process) behavior can be "mechanically" driven, in the sense that actions flow can be directly dependent of physical mobility. To support this concept, we introduce a programming and execution model allowing designing computing and information systems driven directly by arranging and moving physical objects in the space. We demonstrate the use of the model to implement a few practical applications, highlighting its simplicity and expression power.},

  abstract={Many Collect ive Adaptive Systems (CASs) exist in nature: think of ant colonies, where large collectives of ants operate autonomously but interact with other ants and the environment to provide resilient global behaviors that sustain their colony. Following scientific studies that were aimed at understanding and predicting the evolution of these systems, and fueled by technological advances, research has started to investigate CAS engineering: the methods, tools, and techniques for building CASs. This naturally leads to a vision where collectives of humans and computational elements, situated both in the digital and physical worlds, collaborate to give rise to "intelligent" collective behavior supporting novel kinds of applications and services. Humans can be involved in two ways: both as users and as components of the CAS, in the sense that human behaviors and limitations are often integral to the system description. This has significant social implications that need to be considered by CAS researchers: in this paper, we share a discussion that took place between some experts thinking about CAS engineering, focusing on the social implication of CASs and related open research challenges. We hope that this provides a useful context for future research projects, research grant proposals, and research directions.},

  abstract={The thrust of this article is this: There is a need now, more than ever before, for men to stretch their capacities in what we shall call evolutionary skills. Moreover, it is at last becoming possible technologically to enhance these skills in man by incorporating somewhat similar evolutionary skills in the machines which we design and build. However, if engineers are to develop machines with evolutionary capabilities, they will need to restructure their own way of thinking, throw out traditional ways of thinking, and find their way, through playing with evolutionary design techniques, into an ever-deepening understanding of the significance of such techniques. They must bootstrap themselves into a new kind of ``think,'' into a new climate of man-machine interaction, in which men evolve intelligent machines and intelligent machines evolve men. This new kind of think is what this article tries to unfold in an effort to spur lively support for the evolutionary direction.},

  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={115435-115468},
  abstract={This research aims to analyze the Digital Social Networks (DSN) behavior, constructed from the network’s relationships, interactions, and expressions of users’ private states through collective subjectivity. For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities’ granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings’ communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.},

  title={A Multi-CBR Algorithm Based on Comprehensive Evaluation for Operation Planning of Helicopter}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},

  pages={124110-124122},
  abstract={Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an effective reasoning technology. The core idea of CBR is using past experience and expert knowledge to solve new problems. Operation planning of helicopter mainly relies on the experiences of the decision-maker, so CBR is an effective reasoning technology which can be used in the operation planning. Two key issues, evaluation method and case adaptation, are widely focused in CBR method. However, the existing CBR is not suitable for non-numeric optimization problem such as operation planning, because it belongs to small sample size problem. To solve this problem, the comprehensive evaluation based multi-CBR (CEB-mCBR) method is proposed in this paper, which can be used for operation planning of helicopter. According to the comprehensive evaluation theory, similar historical case set of the target case is established, and the historical operation plans are ranked. On this basis, the optimum initial plan for the target case is generated by the case screening CBR model. Then the solution element screening CBR model is further put forward to solve the issue of case adaptation. The CEB-mCBR method comprises multi-CBR (case screening CBR and solution element screening CBR) and combination evaluation method. It can integrate expert experience and human thinking better, especially when solution space is limited. Finally, through a case study analysis, the multi-CBR model can generate a feasible solution for the target case, and the solution elements can be adjusted according to the situation in the actual operation, which can improve the efficiency of operation planning while keeping the safety, economy and operating efficiency.},

  pages={77737-77749},
  abstract={Project-based learning (PBL) is an active learning methodology focused on developing both soft and hard skills by solving real-world problems. In PBL, teachers act as facilitators while students take charge of their own learning. While the practice of this methodology in computing education has been growing in recent years, it still poses some challenges that need to be addressed. Integrating Scrum and Agile methodologies into PBL can be a valuable addition when teaching computing subjects to students. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a successful implementation of PBL with Scrum, applying Agile values and principles to teach Artificial Intelligence to undergraduate students. This study contributes to the limited research on Scrum in education, as well as helps bridge the research gap in AI teaching and learning. The case study involved 30 students from an undergraduate computing program, divided into five groups, who successfully developed five different Machine Learning (ML) models to tackle the challenging real-life problem of breast cancer prediction for the Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo. The findings of the study indicate that the students effectively utilized Scrum and Agile methodologies throughout the process and expressed satisfaction with the approach. Additionally, they developed problem-solving abilities, critical thinking and communication skills, teamwork capabilities, and gained experience in working with real-life situations and problems. The study also demonstrates that the proposed technique aligns with the foundations of the PBL approach in computing education discussed in previous literature. It serves as a valuable resource for future research on PBL implementation, by comparing similarities and differences with existing literature and discussing the strategies employed to address implementation challenges.},

  abstract={A cognition learning algorithm based on a deep belief network and inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented and examined in a humanoid robot. The psychology concepts were adopted from Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. The human brain comprises two systems, System 1 and System 2. Based on their characteristics, System 1 and System 2 handle different tasks during cerebration. In this study, Deep Belief Network (DBN) is trained to construct the function of System 1 for the rapid reaction. On the other hand, PSO is applied to build System 2 for the slow and complicated brain behavior. Through the cooperation of System 1 and System 2, the proposed cognition learning algorithm can apply the psychology theories to allow the humanoid robot for learning the suitable pitching postures autonomously. In the experiments conducted in this study, the robot was trained for only five selected points and was then asked to throw precisely to nine points. The proposed algorithm provided 100% accuracy in the robot pitching game. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was thus verified.},

  abstract={Different individual features of the learner data often work as essential indicators of learning and intervention needs. This work exploits the personas in the design thinking process as the theoretical basis to analyze and cluster learners’ learning behavior patterns as groups. To adapt to the learning practice, we develop data-driven personas by clustering learners’ features based on factual learning outcomes (i.e., knowledge gain, perceived learning experience, perceived social presence) based on unsupervised learning, a more accessible and objective intervention design strategy for e-reading practices. Using the Chi-square test, we quantitatively evaluate different clusters driven by various unsupervised learning methods on the multimodal SKEP dataset. Furthermore, for a more practical real-life application, we achieved automatic persona prediction based on the attention regulation behaviors of learners. The subject-independent evaluation results indicate the best classification accuracy of 70% for the four-level classification task, differentiating three personas of learners with needs and another without feedback needs. It also shows that time-based sampling on both independent and cumulative learner behaviors works as robust predictors of learner personas, achieving a stable accuracy range of 65%-70% throughout the e-reading with the SVM classifier. Our work inspires the design of a real-time feedback loop for e-learning based on conversational agents.},

  abstract={Emotion perception similar to thinking, learning and remembering is consequent of complicated brain processes which are related to specific biological metabolism. Different human's emotional states are recognizable by measuring and interpreting of human physiological signals. Bio-sensors possess a number of advantages against other emotion recognition methods as they are relatively more consistent across cultures and nations. Emotions have a serious effect on driving. Human beings in negative and sometimes positive emotional states can be distracted which will increase the risk of driving. This paper presents an EEG-based emotion recognition system. Mutual information and magnitude squared coherence are applied to investigate the interconnectivity between 8 scalp regions. A study was performed to collect 8 channels of EEG data from 26 healthy right-handed subjects in experiencing 4 emotional states while exposed to audio-visual emotional stimuli. After feature extraction, 5-fold cross-validation was then performed using the KNN and SVM classifier. The results showed existence of different kind of functional brain connectivity in different emotional states.},

  abstract={As the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research field is relatively young and interdisciplinary, we spend a good deal of time and effort on communicating with each other, sharing ideas and empirical findings across disciplinary boundaries. While this practice is important and needs to continue, there is an increasingly pressing need for us to also communicate outside of this research community. I have met way too many designers, engineers, product managers, and roboticists, who tell me that they were either unaware that there was an HRI research community or that they have found our research community and have been disappointed by our work. That is unfortunate and it is fixable. Like the Human-Computer Interaction research community, we need to tackle this research-practice gap [1]. In this talk, I will make the case for why and how we might get started. There is so much to be gained by taking a Translational Science approach to HRI research. There are opportunities to do work that is grounded in real world problems, real people, and real robots. Furthermore, there are opportunities to make a difference in the design and deployment of robotic products and services right now. As just one example, in spending time studying robot deployments in service industries, at sea, and in the sky, we kept meeting professional Robot Wranglers. In many of our research projects, graduate students take on the Robot Wrangler role, which we claim will eventually disappear when the robots become “fully” autonomous. Looking across many industries, I believe that Robot Wranglers are here to stay. We could and should study them as real stakeholders and people. As HRI researchers, we have an opportunity to use our work to more directly inform the design of technologies. We can also find inspiration from the study of empirical [2]. I think it is time to roll up our sleeves and get better at communicating and working with the people who are building the future of robotics now. Publishing and presenting peer-reviewed papers is not where our work ends. We have much more work to do in translating our work in ways that will help others outside of our research community actually make use of our insights, engaging in collaborations with them, and coming back here to share and learn from stories about those experiences.},

  abstract={It is important that we analyze walking stability of physically unimpaired persons as one aspect of preventive medicine. There are many cases of unstable walking even if people think they are in good health. It is considered that if they continue to walk unstably, this may cause lower-back pain or knee pain; this burden also exerts bad influences upon other physical parts. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using an acceleration measurement system. Using this system, we measured the acceleration displacement at the COG of a normal walking subject and evaluated walking stability quantitatively. The center of gravity (COG) plays an important role in evaluation of stability for both standing posture and walking. By using the seasonal adjustment model it was possible to predict the periodic fluctuations observed, decomposing the original data into factors representing stability and instability. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using the ratio of the variance of the noise component vs. the variance of periodic component. This study provides useful information for understanding walking systems in preventive medicine and rehabilitative medicine.},

  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={141-141},
  abstract={Summary form only given. As technology advances, many human-like robots are being developed. These humanoid robots should be classified as inanimate objects; however, they share many properties with human beings. This raises the question of how infants classify them. Developmental psychology has addressed the issue of how infants come to characterize humans as agents having mental states that is indispensable foundation for sociality. Some studies suggest that infants attribute mental states only to humans. For instance, Legerstee et al. (2000) found that 6-month-old infants do expect people to communicate with people, not with objects. These results indicate that human cognition specializes in human in early infancy. Other studies have suggested, however, that infants attribute mental states to non-human objects that appear to be interactive with a person. For instance, Johnson et al. (1999) indicated that 12-month-old infants did gaze following to a non-human but interactive stuff. These results imply that interactivity between humans and objects is the key factor in mental attribution, however, interesting questions remain to be answered: do infants also have expectation for robots to communicate with person? In this study, we investigated whether 6-month-old infants expected an experimenter to talk to a humanoid robot "Robovie" [Ishiguro, et al., (2001) using infants' looking time as a measurement of violation-of-expectation. Violation-of-expectation method uses infants' property that they look longer at the event that they do not expect than at the event that they expect. During test trials, we show infants the stimulus in which an actor talks to the robot and another person. If infants regard robots as communicative existence like human, they will not be surprised and look at the robot as long as at the person. But if infants do not attribute communicational property to robots, they will look longer at the robot than at the person. To show infants how the robot behaved and interacted with people, we added a familiarization period prior to the test trials, which phase provided infants with prior knowledge about the robots. The stimuli in the familiarization of these conditions are as follows: 1) interactive robot condition: the robot behaved like a human, and the person and the robot interacted with each other; 2) non-active robot condition: the robot was stationary and the person was both active and talked to the robot; 3) active robot condition: the robot behaved like a human, and the person was stationary and silent. If the robots' appearance is dominant for expectation, the results of all condition are same. If robot' action is dominant, the results of the interactive robot condition and the active robot condition are same. And if human-robot interaction is dominant, the result of the interactive robot condition is only different. In the results, infants who had watched the interactive robot looked at the robot as long as at the person. However, infants who had previously observed other robots (non-active robot and active robot) looked longer at the robot than at the person. A previous study suggested that infants come to think of the same robot as intentional agents earlier than they can attribute simple geometric object as intentional agents (Kamewari, et al.). Therefore, it is thought that early infants have the cognitive base that specialized in appearance. Our findings, however, imply that early infants are also sensitive about external forms of human communications, such as "turn-taking" (Trevarthen, 1980), so they come to regard a non-human target as communicative by learning},

  abstract={In order to study brain function, some researchers have attempted to reverse-engineer neuronal networks and even the brain itself. This approach was based on the assumption that neurons in-vivo acted just like simple transistors in-silico. Unfortunately, both network and whole-brain modeling based on this premise have led to very little insight into actual brain function. The evidence for this claim is two-fold. First, the amount of energy needed to operate computing machinery that isn't anywhere near as complex as the human brain still requires much more energy than the latter. Second, because transistor-based computing reacts to static events whilst neurons can react to processes, properties inherent to computing architectures hardware prevent the true level of complexity and connectivity achieved in the human brain from being realized in-silico. In contrast to transistors, neurons can establish and change their connections and vary their signaling properties according to a variety of rules, allowing them to adapt to circumstances, self-assemble, auto-calibrate and store information by changing their properties according to experience (Laughlin & Sejnowski, 2003). In this speech, we elaborate on this evidence, and argue that there is a need to re-think the way we approach brain computation. In particular, we argue for a detailed understanding of neuronal function and network organization is required prior to neuronal network modeling attempt.},

  abstract={For forty years, much human electrophysiologic thinking has been based on the concept that EEG data recorded from the scalp following sensory stimulation are dominated by successive far-field correlates of bottom-up brain sensory processing, as represented in evoked potential (EP) averages. I will present evidence for an alternate view that human EEG data are dominated by oscillatory processes relating to time-varying, top-down control of cortical dynamics and attention. This view suggests a reorientation of scientific and engineering focus towards modeling brain dynamics of humans as active operators rather than as passive perceivers and programmed responders. Such research presents new engineering challenges. There is a need, first, to understand and model the process of partial phase resetting of ongoing and intermittent nonlinear oscillatory processes, and more generally, of inter-process synchronization. Methods we have developed or integrated for EEG research, including independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency analysis, now allow detection and modeling of such brain dynamic events from high-dimensional electrical data collected noninvasively from the human scalp. It is probable that real time signal processing capable of separating EEG processes from non-brain signals and of monitoring brain synchronization events may allow high-level cognitive monitoring that could be used in man-machine interfaces and for neuropsychological training.},

  abstract={In the Exa-scale era, one of the most important and tough problems is how to enhance the sustained performance against the limited power budget. Traditional multi-or many-core general CPUs are still popular for easy programming and porting of general applications. However, it is getting to face to the limit by semiconductor technology limit, memory capacity per core, network bandwidth, etc. GPU represents the attached accelerator solution in heterogeneous computing thanks to its high peak performance ratio to power consumption, and moreover, recent progress on AI applications such as TensorFlow ready NVIDIA GPUs. However, GPU's extremely high performance is provided by wide width of data parallel computation both in instruction level and core/thread level which requires thousands of SIMD operations simultaneously executed. Many of success stories on GPU acceleration depend on their simple parallel execution and quite low rate of exception (if statements) handling. Another problem is the interconnection network which relies on CPU-bundle high performance network such as InfiniBand. In our research team has been focusing on the FPGA computation, which is one of the hot topics of new type of accelerators for HPC, however it is quite difficult to achieve a comparable performance with GPU especially for SIMD style applications. So, we think that a new generation of accelerated computing supported by multiple heterogeneous accelerator platform including several types of ones together on computation node. The first target is a combination of GPU and FPGA to provide 360-degree solution with SIMD and pipelined parallelism depending on the characteristics of each computation part of a large application. In this talk, I will introduce the current status of our Multi-Hetero Accelerated System running on University of Tsukuba, its hardware and software development, and real application with preliminary performance evaluation.},

  abstract={The mechanical behaviors of a composite superconducting strand, which is composed of a variety of materials with different mechanical properties, are difficult to be accurately predicted using traditional mechanical methods due to the complex modeling process and difficulties in dealing with the interactions among different materials as well as material failure. In this paper, a three-dimensional equivalent discrete element model of an NbTi/Cu composite strand is established by twisting process first, and its mechanical response under external load is successfully achieved by introducing different material constitutive relations into contact models discriminatively and taking the filament fracture into consideration. This model can reduce the modeling process largely and acquire more accurate results, which can also provide a new thinking in predicting the mechanical performance of other superconducting strand or composite material.},

  abstract={The concept of a bandgap is so deeply ingrained that it is hard to imagine an integrated circuit built on graphene, whose pristine state is a gapless material with charge carriers obeying the relativistic Dirac spectrum, analogous to light. Entertaining such notion is so appalling that many have proposed to cut graphene into bits and pieces, thinking that size quantization effect would recover a bandgap. Unfortunately, the edges are too disordered and unzipping nanotubes simply unzips more nightmares for device integration engineers. Embracing pristine graphene with its Dirac spectrum therefore appeals as a viable technological option worth careful investigation. Such “all-graphene electronics”, in which graphene is kept pristine and lithographic patterning is performed on the electrostatic gates or substrates instead, is the subject of this talk.},

  abstract={Nowadays, with the phenomenon of the world ageing getting serious, the demand for intelligent medical treatment becomes higher than past. A series of smart bracelets have been launched for the health of the elderly, which can detect the health condition of the elderly in real-time. When an abnormal phenomenon occurs and the rescue will be needed, it can transmit the signal to the medical platform of the hospital or the mobile phone of its guardian, and then the hospital would send an ambulance and relevant doctors to rescue the patient. This paper mainly studies the starting bracelet sensors to collect data to rescue behavior of the entire process, proposes a Petri net model of distributed resource allocation based on cloud medical system. Through the structural analysis of the model and the construction of the algorithm, the rationality and efficiency of the whole system model are verified, and the case study shows that the model can effectively find the optimal scheduling path and each part of the system can respond well.},

  title={Navigating the Pitfalls: Analyzing the Behavior of LLMs as a Coding Assistant for Computer Science Students—A Systematic Review of the Literature}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={112605-112625},
  abstract={In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.},

  abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) is a fascinating paradigm in which all things and objects are connected together, it holds a significant position in fostering intelligent high-level services. However, the future IoT architecture is still under evolution profiting from the overwhelming development of cyberspace and cyber technologies. Based on the traditional physical-based IoT, social-inspired Internet of People (IoP) and brain-abstracted Internet of Thinking (IoTk), an intelligent embryo of cyber-enabled Internet of X (IoX) is being established where all things, entities, people and thinking are interacted seamlessly. In this article, we clearly introduce the cyber-enabled IoX from perspective of both ubiquitous connections and space convergence, and design an architecture with four pillars, namely, things, people, thinking and cyberentities in respective spaces. In addition, we analyze the fundamental issues in IoX development, such as information exploding, link exploding and application exploding from the view of ubiquitous connections, entity exploding and relationship exploding on the basis of space convergence, and service exploding from overall aspects, where potential solutions are discussed at the same time. The intelligent cyber-enabled IoX will be the cornerstone for future techniques and applications, and proves to be the solid foundation for upcoming intelligent and proactive era.},

Artificial Intelligence with the help of big data has transformed all industries around the world Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human or animal intelligence in computational systems so that they are programmed to think like Intelligent beings and mimic the actions of intelligent entities. Computational systems which have programmed intelligence can solve different real-world problems far more accurately and efficiently than computational systems that are deterministic and hardcoded. Since many problems in business and business analytics cannot be solved by deterministic systems, AI plays a major role in tackling problems in the business world Machine learning and deep learning which are subsets of the field of AI is widely used to solve and optimize many problems in business such as marketing, credit card fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service, portfolio management, product recommendation according to the needs of customers, insurance underwriting.

AS are advanced intelligent systems and general AI technologies triggered by the transdisciplinary development in intelligence science, system science, brain science, cognitive science, robotics, computational intelligence, and intelligent mathematics. It is recognized that, in a rigorous perspective, the only matured AS is human brains and human collective intelligence. It explains why there was rarely man-made AS in the past half century, because of the theoretical, mathematical, computational, and programming language unreadiness. Therefore, the ultimate goal of AS is to implement a brain-inspired system that may think and behave as a human counterpart in hybrid intelligent systems and general AI implementations. There is no doubt that AS will be increasingly demanded by the intelligence-based industries and societies for cognitive computers, deep machine learning systems, robotics, brain-inspired systems, mission-critical systems, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent appliances.},

  abstract={This paper presents the conceptualization proposed by Ignacio Matte Blanco of the functioning of conscious and unconscious thinking. In his original view the two ways of thinking are conceived as two distinct logics, “symmetrical” and “asymmetrical” logics. In this study the fundamentals of his concepts are identified and re-elaborated in a more formal way, with the aim of developing an operational and dynamic functional structure that evolves over time and that includes the affective value of objects. On this basis a computational implementation of the conscious-unconscious interaction that employs Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) is put forward. The reason for this choice is that LCS have a structural affinity with the proposed ideas, and in particular they allow to model directly the psychodynamic concept of “internal reality”.},

  year={2015},
  volume={61},

  pages={3-16},
  abstract={We prove that, for all binary-input symmetric memoryless channels, polar codes enable reliable communication at rates within an additive gap  $ \varepsilon > 0$  to the Shannon capacity with a block length, construction complexity, and decoding complexity, all bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . Polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties; previous constructions were not known to achieve capacity with less than  $\exp (1/ \varepsilon )$  decoding complexity except for erasure channels. We establish the capacity-achieving property of polar codes via a direct analysis of the underlying martingale of conditional entropies, without relying on the martingale convergence theorem. This step gives rough polarization (noise levels  $\approx \varepsilon $  for the good channels), which can then be adequately amplified by tracking the decay of the channel Bhattacharyya parameters. Our effective bounds imply that polar codes can have block length (and encoding/decoding complexity) bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . The generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time by algorithmically computing an adequate approximation of the polarization process.},

  title={Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={62},
  number={3},
  pages={1097-1118},
  abstract={Non-malleable codes, introduced by Dziembowski et al., encode messages s in a manner, so that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output s or a message that is independent of s. While this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family P of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when I≤I 22αn for some α <; 1, where n is the number of bits in a codeword). In this paper, we study the capacity of non-malleable codes, and establish optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size, answering an open problem from Dziembowski et al. Specifically, We prove that for every family P with IFI I≤I 22αn, there exist non-malleable codes against P with rate arbitrarily close to 1-α [this is achieved with high probability (w.h.p.) by a randomized construction]. We show the existence of families of size exp(nO(1)2αn) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 - α (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). We also show that 1 - α is the best achievable rate for the family of functions, which are only allowed to tamper the first αn bits of the codeword, which is of special interest. As a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword, a model which has received some attention recently) equals 1/2. We also give an efficient Monte Carlo construction of codes of rate close to 1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any fixed c > 0 and family P of size 2nc, in particular tampering functions with, say, cubic size circuits.},

  abstract={Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.},

  abstract={Emotion recognition involves accurately interpreting human emotions from various sources and modalities, including questionnaires, verbal, and physiological signals. With its broad applications in affective computing, computational creativity, human-robot interactions, and market research, the field has seen a surge in interest in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) techniques developed from 2014 to 2024, encompassing verbal, physiological signals, facial, body gesture, and speech as well as emerging methods like sketches emotion recognition. The review explores various emotion models, distinguishing between emotions, feelings, sentiments, and moods, along with human emotional expression, categorized in both artistic and non-verbal ways. It also discusses the background of automated emotion recognition systems and introduces seven criteria for evaluating modalities alongside a current state analysis of MER, drawn from the human-centric perspective of this field. By selecting the PRISMA guidelines and carefully analyzing 45 selected articles, this review provides comprehensive perspectives into existing studies, datasets, technical approaches, identified gaps, and future directions in MER. It also highlights existing challenges and current applications of the MER.},

In addition, we reduce the blind area of sensors by adding one more DOF to adjust the convergent angle of the two cameras. This configuration is suitable for scanning items with different sizes, complex shapes, and sophisticated structures due to the flexibility in approaching the object. Then, the research develops a robot-based iterative closest point method for point cloud registration. This 3D reconstruction strategy enhances the accuracy as well as the computational time of the point cloud processing. After that, we conduct several real-world experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed system and algorithm.},

  abstract={The requirement for reductions in CO2, NOX and noise emissions from aviation have come under great assiduity. The use of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems within aircraft offer potential performance and efficiency improvements, through reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and reduction in noise. This work proposes a novel multidisciplinary simulation tool, capable of determining optimised propulsion system parameters for various measures of merit (MoM), based on preliminary or conceptual aircraft specifications. Overall power, control and drive system which is to be used within the propulsion systems of hybrid and / or all electric aircraft applications can be determined from the simulation tool. Using an initial sizing algorithm to consider aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems, taking power-to-weight ratio (P/W), wing loading (W/S), and hybridisation of power, as inputs to a mission analysis, and performing an optimisation study to determine a MoM, it has been possible to expand on work in this field with the addition of a supplementary branch in the sizing methodology to include a sizing analysis for the components of an aircraft’s electric propulsion system. The designed program enables accurate sizing of powertrain, optimises overall masses, and allows rapid sizing with minimal computational expense.},

  abstract={The security of computer programs and systems is a very critical issue. With the number of attacks launched on computer networks and software, businesses and IT professionals are taking steps to ensure that their information systems are as secure as possible. However, many programmers do not think about adding security to their programs until their projects are near completion. This is a major mistake because a system is as secure as its weakest link. If security is viewed as an afterthought, it is highly likely that the resulting system will have a large number of vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. One of the reasons programmers overlook adding security to their code is because it is viewed as a complicated or time-consuming process. This paper presents a tool that will help programmers think more about security and add security tactics to their code with ease. We created a model that learns from existing open source projects and documentation using machine learning and text mining techniques. Our tool contains a module that runs in the background to analyze code as the programmer types and offers suggestions of where security could be included. In addition, our tool fetches existing open source implementations of cryptographic algorithms and sample code from repositories to aid programmers in adding security easily to their projects.},

  abstract={To show the traditional Chinese painting and the spiritual culture of universities, highlight the artistic accumulation and cultural heritage, analyze the value and significance of digitalizing the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting, Qingdao Agricultural University (QAU) is regarded as the research object. The design principles of the digital museum are clarified by understanding the specific user needs, and the 3DS Max is utilized to develop a roaming system for the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU through Unity3d, a Virtual Reality (VR) software platform. Besides, the perspective control, collision detection of virtual characters and scenes, and control of pop-up information display windows are realized to achieve the interactive design of users and the QAU digital museum system. Finally, from the four aspects of resource content, information presentation, resource presentation, and learning effect, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The research results show that more than 80% of people think that the content satisfaction of virtual system resources is high, which is more scientific and accurate; more than 65% think that the information is presented better, and 87% think that the system is open enough; in addition, nearly one-third of the visitors believe that using the system can initiate their interest and motivation in learning. This shows that the learning and cultural communication effects of the virtual system are more obvious. This system realizes the objective of disseminating traditional classic art culture and values by new technical means, which has reference significance for research in other fields.},

  abstract={Quantization is an integral part of image acquisition but also a major performance bottleneck due to the trade-off between dynamic range and resolution. As we discuss in this paper, in contrast, quantization noise can be acquired reliably even beyond the dynamic range by re-purposing recent hardware development. In this paper, we introduce and mathematically analyze an algorithm to recover images from this information, thus giving rise to a novel, single-shot, high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging approach. Our method directly works with a refined model for sensor outputs at the digitization stage and crucially exploits smoothing anti-aliasing artifacts. We derive recovery guarantees and demonstrate the validity of our approach via computer experiments. Our work suggests re-thinking of the imaging pipeline as seeming sensing artifacts can lead to improved reconstruction when combined with proper computational methodology.},

VSA is an interdisciplinary approach grounded on systems thinking and resource-based theory, and focused on methodologies to govern relations among supra-systems and subsystems. Leveraging on the systems perspective of the creativity proposed by Csikszentmihalyi, we defined a way to analyse and understand how the variety introduced by workers in organization can lead to novel and useful products and services. We present also our preliminary results on how a well-defined set of knowledge based methodologies and techniques, resulting from the ARISTOTELE research project, can be applied to this purpose in the context of a Gene lore model. We believe our proposal, i.e. the application of VSA methods combined with knowledge based techniques, can lead to substantial advantages in several areas of Computational Creativity.},

  abstract={Decision making is one of the common human activities. But in complex, interactive, and dynamic systems, it is extremely important to make decisions scientifically because the influence of the behavior after decision making is generally irreversible. The predictability of behavior influence is an effective way to improve the scientific decision making. As a new branch of computing, computational experiment is an emerging management method for research on complex systems. In this paper, based on particle swarm intelligence, an evolutionary adaptive system model of brand innovation in the toy industry cluster is constructed. By imitating the evolution process of the complex adaptive system, this method is helpful to analyze the impact of the management behavior brought to simulation system, predict the management behavior in real world, and finally choose the best management strategy. This simulation tried to figure out the affection of government regulation strategies and provide corresponding assessments and recommendations, which gives a new solution to assist the government to effectively judge the influence of the macro policy, as well as provides a new way of thinking of the related intelligent decision making.},

  abstract={Thinking about the protection of biometric data, future attacks using a quantum computer call for adequate resistance of biometric verification systems. Such systems are often deployed on a long-term basis and deserve strong protection due to the sensitive nature and persistence property of the data they contain. To achieve efficient template protection, we combine post-quantum secure two-party computation with secret sharing and apply the first practically implemented post-quantum secure two-party computation protocol for the purpose of biometric template protection. The proposed system ensures permanent protection of the biometric data as templates are stored and compared in the encrypted domain. For the verification, we present two options which can be achieved as real-time transactions: A well-established classical two-party computation scheme or a recent post-quantum upgrade of that scheme. Both methods maintain full biometric performance. For the database of reference templates, which is a target for attacks in a biometric system, post-quantum security is maintained throughout both verification options. Regarding the computational efficiency of our proposed system, we offer real-time computational transaction times, making our solution relevant for practical applications.},

  title={Supporting the Commander's information requirements: Automated support for Battle Drill processes using R-CAST}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1523-1528},
  abstract={This paper discusses a novel approach that addresses the problem of supporting the Commander's dynamic information requirements through automation of the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) for time-constrained environments and training purposes, as part of the Tactical Human Integration of Networked Knowledge (THINK) Army Technology Objective - Research (ATO-R) initiative. We demonstrate this capability with automated user support for the execution of battle drills. Our approach is based on adapting the R-CAST cognitively-inspired agent architecture towards a context-aware anticipation of information requirements. R-CAST is a computational model of the Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model, which models human decision making under time stress. R-CAST agents support and collaborate with human decision making teams as both “smart aids” and “effective teammates” by anticipating, investigating, seeking, and interpreting information relevant to decision making. A key feature of R-CAST is that the proactive sharing of information relevant to decision making is automatically generated by the computational RPD model. The fundamental research question being addressed is whether the inclusion of R-CAST in Army staff processes improves said staff understanding and execution of battle tasks. We adapted R-CAST to Battle Drill #26 (i.e., responding to an IED event) as a proof of concept for team decision making under stress and constant switching of modalities. We demonstrate that the use of R-CAST cognitive agents effectively assists the Battle Manager in the S3 cell with auto-filling certain forms required by doctrine in response to the dynamism of the current state of the environment, improving cognitive performance in this task. Our novel approach integrates relevant context in communication, information, and socio-cognitive networks, coupled with cognitive modeling. We report initial findings that we can use the R-CAST cognitive framework to effectively and efficiently develop individual intelligent training tools that understand and support the dynamic information requirements of Commanders.},

  abstract={Phishing, a prevalent cyber danger in contemporary times, involves the fraudulent impersonation of legitimate websites with the intention of deceiving users into divulging confidential information. The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the “Zérosdetect” approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning’s adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing.},

  abstract={Entrepreneurship education is critical in encouraging students' innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. It provides essential skills and knowledge, enabling them to open their creative potential and apply innovative thinking across diverse professional fields. With the widespread application of large language models in education, intelligent-assisted teaching in entrepreneurship education is stepping into a new learning phase anytime and anywhere. Entrepreneurship education extends across interdisciplinary knowledge fields, incorporating subjects like finance and risk management, which require advanced mathematical computational skills. This complexity presents new challenges for artificial-intelligence-assisted question-and-answer models. The study explores how students can maximize the knowledge repository of current large language models to improve learning efficiency and experimentally validates the performance differences between large language models and graph convolutional reasoning models regarding the complex semantic reasoning and mathematical computational demands in entrepreneurship education questions. Based on case studies, it is found that despite the broad prospects of large language models in entrepreneurship education, they still need to improve in practical applications. Especially in tasks within entrepreneurship education that demand precision, such as mathematical computations and risk assessment, the accuracy and efficiency of existing models still need improvement. Therefore, further exploration into algorithm optimization, model fusion, and other technical enhancements can improve the processing capabilities of intelligent question-and-answer systems for specific domain issues, aiming to meet the practical needs of entrepreneurship education.},

  abstract={Scientific data processing and visualization of computational simulation data have played an important role in knowledge creation, and its transfer for the benefit of society, through scientific discovery and understanding of physical and chemical phenomena. Massively parallel processing architecture has greatly contributed to increase the computational power and to enlarge the scale of computation. This facilitated the generation of larger and larger amounts of data. To tackle this oncoming tsunami of data, we propose a post-processing system for large-scale data focusing on the idea that a post-processing system needs to be an assistant of the researchers thinking process. We present a probable design solution targeting continuous development, and the technologies for productivity improvement such as collaborative work and visualization.

  abstract={Crowd sourcing is evolving as a distributed problem-solving and business production model in recent years. In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In 2003, Luis von Ahn and his colleagues pioneered the concept of "human computation", which utilizes human abilities to perform computation tasks that are difficult for computers to process. Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis. In this paper, we give a survey on the literature on crowd sourcing which are categorized according to their applications, algorithms, performances and datasets. This paper provides a structured view of the research on crowd sourcing to date.},

  pages={13825-13848},
  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has important applications in our daily lives, including health and fitness tracking, environmental monitoring, and transportation. However, sensor nodes in IoT suffer from the limited lifetime of batteries resulting from their finite energy availability. A promising solution is to harvest energy from environmental sources, such as solar, kinetic, thermal, and radio-frequency (RF) waves, for perpetual and continuous operation of IoT sensor nodes. In addition to energy generation, recently energy harvesters have been used for context detection, eliminating the need for conventional activity sensors (e.g., accelerometers), saving space, cost, and energy consumption. Using energy harvesters for simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting enables energy positive sensing-an important and emerging class of sensors, which harvest more energy than required for context detection and the additional energy can be used to power other components of the system. Although simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting is an important step forward toward autonomous self-powered sensor nodes, the energy and information availability can be still intermittent, unpredictable, and temporally misaligned with various computational tasks on the sensor node. This article provides a comprehensive survey on task scheduling algorithms for the emerging class of energy harvesting-based sensors (i.e., energy positive sensors) to achieve the sustainable operation of IoT. We discuss inherent differences between conventional sensing and energy positive sensing and provide an extensive critical analysis for devising revised task scheduling algorithms incorporating this new class of sensors. Finally, we outline future research directions toward the implementation of autonomous and self-powered IoT.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={92398-92409},
  abstract={Risk priority number (RPN) is a widely used approach, and it is a powerful means to assess the criticality of modes in a failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) worksheet. In the application of the traditional FMECA, the RPN is determined to rank the failure modes; however, the method has been criticized several times for having many drawbacks and weaknesses, such as the presence of gaps in the range of admissible values, the duplicates value provided by different combinations of the base factors, and the high sensitivity to small changes. This paper analyses and compares some alternative RPN formulation proposed in the literature to overcome these limits. This paper takes into account only the alternative RPN, which proposes a powerful solution without increasing the computational complexity and remaining coherent to the classical idea included in the international standard IEC 60812. In order to compare the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative RPNs, an FMECA was developed for a heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) system in railway application. The critical analysis of the comparison can provide recommendations and suggestions regarding the choice of the alternative RPN based on the type of application. Finally, this paper takes into account the scales reduction of possible values related to the parameters (i.e., occurrence, severity, and detection), which influence the assessment of the RPN. This approach allows the designers to mitigate the drawbacks related to the full scale and provide an easier and faster assessment of the scores to evaluate the criticality analysis and prioritization.},

  abstract={As the skills that constitute literacy evolve to accommodate digital media, computer science education finds itself in a sorry state. While students are more in need of computational skills than ever, computer science suffers dramatically low retention rates and a declining percentage of women and minorities. Studies of the problem point to the overemphasis in computer science classes on abstraction over application, technical details instead of usability, and the stereotypical view of programmers as loners lacking creativity. In spring 2003, Georgia Institute of Technology trialed a new course, Introduction to Media Computation, which teaches programming and computation in the context of media creation and manipulation. Students implement PhotoShop-style filters and digital video special effects, splice sounds, and search Web pages. The course is open only to noncomputer science and nonengineering majors at Georgia Tech, such as liberal arts, management and architecture students. The course is supported through the use of a Web-based collaboration environment where students actively share and discuss their digital creations. The results have been dramatic. 120 students enrolled, 2/3 female, and only three students withdrew. By the end of the semester, the combined withdrawal, failure and D-grade rate had reached 11.5% - compared to 42.9% in the traditional introductory computer science course. 60% of the students who took media computation reported that they would be interested in taking an advanced version of the course; only 6% reported that they would otherwise be interested in taking more computer science. Results of the trial indicate that media computation motivates and engages an audience that is poorly served by traditional computer science courses.},

  abstract={Incorporating research on personality recognition into computers, both from a cognitive as well as an engineering perspective, would facilitate the interactions between humans and machines. Previous attempts on personality recognition have focused on a variety of different corpora (ranging from text to audiovisual data), scenarios (interviews, meetings), channels of communication (audio, video, text), and different subsets of personality traits (out of the five ones from the Big Five Model). Our study uses simple acoustic and visual nonverbal features extracted from multimodal data, which have been recorded in previously uninvestigated scenarios, and consider all five personality traits and not just a subset. First, we look at the human-machine interaction scenario, where we introduce the display of different “collaboration levels.” Second, we look at the contribution of the human-human interaction (HHI) scenario on the emergence of personality traits. Investigating the HHI scenario creates a stronger basis for future human-agents interactions. Our goal is to study, from a computational approach, the emergence degree of the five personality traits in these two scenarios. The results demonstrate the relevance of each of the two scenarios when it comes to the degree of emergence of certain traits and the feasibility to automatically recognize personality under different conditions.},

  pages={86243-86253},
  abstract={This paper develops a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in railway. HVAC is a safety critical system which must ensure emergency ventilation in case of fire and in case of loss of primary ventilation functions. A study of the HVAC's critical areas is mandatory to optimize its reliability and availability and consequently to guarantee a low operation and maintenance cost. The first part of the paper describes the FMECA which is performed and reported to highlight the main criticalities of the HVAC system under analysis. Secondly, the paper deals with the problem of the evaluation of a threshold risk value, which can distinguish negligible and critical failure modes. Literature barely considers the problem of an objective risk threshold estimation. Therefore, a new analytical method based on finite difference is introduced to find a univocal risk threshold value. The method is then tested on two Risk Priority Number datasets related to the same HVAC. The threshold obtained in both cases is a good tradeoff between the risk mitigation and the cost investment for the corrective actions required to mitigate the risk level. Finally, the threshold obtained with the proposed method is compared with the methods available in literature. The comparison shows that the proposed finite difference method is a well-structured technique, with a low computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides results in line with the literature, but it completely deletes the problem of subjectivity.},

  abstract={Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9–12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.},

In turn, the trained DNN is integrated into MCTS to help guide its search effort. We call this approach learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search for Object REtrieval (MORE), which delivers significant computational efficiency gains and added solution optimality.

  abstract={Game designers can use computer-aided game design methods to model how players may experience the perceived difficulty of a game. We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress.},

  abstract={This paper presents a general problem-solving method combining the principles of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation. The problem-solving method is based on the computer language GENETICA, which stands for "Genetic Evolution of Novel Entities Through the Interpretation of Composite Abstractions." GENETICAs programming environment includes a computational system that evolves data abstractions, viewed as genotypes of data generation scenarios for a GENETICA program, with respect to either confirmation or optimization goals. A problem can be formulated as a GENETICA program, while the solution is represented as a data structure resulting from an evolved data generation scenario. This approach to problem solving offers: 1) generality, since it concerns virtually any problem stated in formal logic; 2) effectiveness, since formally expressed problem-solving knowledge can be incorporated in the problem statement; and 3) creativity, since unpredictable solutions can be obtained by evolved data structures. It is shown that domain specific languages, including genetic programming ones, that inherit GENETICAs features can be developed in GENETICA. The language G-CAD, specialized to problem solving in the domain of architectural design, is presented as a case study followed by experimental results.},

  abstract={Advancing technology nodes have increased the impact of lithography variation on design yield and performance. Although lithographic distortion is emerging as the dominant mode of failure, particulate defect still remains an important source of defect. In this work, we present a novel critical area analysis technique that deals with non-deterministic line edges that arise due to statistical lithography variations. Previous critical area analysis techniques are based on fixed printed structures with variable defect sizes. The proposed solution integrates lithographic variations within critical area analysis, using available tools while keeping the computational complexity in check. The key optimizations include weighted stratified sampling of important lithographic parameters and Monte Carlo based Probability of Failure (POF) calculation that is scalable to large chips. Simulation results on ISCAS benchmarks show that inclusion of lithography induced physical variations can increase critical area by as much as 2X, while overall yield due to particulate defects in large designs may decrease by more than 5%; validating both the need for an integrated solution and its feasibility on large designs.},

  title={Effect of associative rules on the dynamics of conceptual combination in a neurodynamical model},

  abstract={Most models of thought are based on the idea of associative memory: The combination of distinct concepts through their association with each other based on experience. Thus, the pattern of associations in the mind is thought to be a critical factor in determining the ideas - both familiar and unfamiliar - that thought can generate. The Itinerant Dynamics with Emergent Attractors (IDEA) model has been proposed as a computational representation of the process by which ideas might emerge in an associative memory system. However, the effect of how “association” is defined in this context remains an important unexplored issue. In this paper, we consider three different ways of defining associations between concepts based on their joint usage in texts, and show that these lead to very different dynamics in the process of emergent conceptual combinations. We use data from two real-world text corpora to instantiate the model: The collected poems of Dylan Thomas, and the Memoirs of the economist Ludwig von Mises. The two sources differ greatly in the nature of their content as well as the statistics of their word usage, which makes them interesting subjects for comparison.},
