  abstract={Artificial intelligence is a part machine language. Both are the result of intelligence of human. In modern days, humans are creating lots of new machine and that help out time, save energy. First human think about the idea about AI and then as a result it comes out as a machine language. Computer knowledge is very important for that. This research is based on machine language and artificial intelligence and their effects on business. Upgrading both of this process and checking their security are also essential. Unemployment is a side effect of this good work. AI and MI can reduce human work and as it's costly for maintenance, most of the business is looking for less employee and more machines.},

In order to analysis of accessibility, the spatial interaction model is known as a general model because it has been developed by entropy maximization principle for a long history. From observed data about traffic flow, our model can estimate traffic volume among inside and outside of target area by using observed traffic flow data. It can be regarded as a merged concept between the geographical advantage and accessibility of the spatial interaction model in unified way. The parameter estimation procedure for the proposed model is developed.},

  abstract={Since some decades ago, cybercrimes have not only increased but it is also becoming more complex. The attackers are using more sophisticated techniques for data breaching. As humans take more time to understand the patterns of cyber-attacks, traditional methods of cyber security were not as much relevant. Henceforth, in the late 1980s the concept of artificial intelligence combined with cyber security, came into existence. Due to the machine learning and deep learning concepts humans teach the machine to detect the threats. By taking the help of big data machine learn the different patterns of attacks. By the concepts of deep learning the machine is able to learn from experiences, it can remember the patterns of different attacks. Neural networks make it possible for a machine to think like humans. Now when a threat arises the artificial intelligence is able to detect and take an action against it. It is true that the artificial intelligence has totally changed the world of cyber security but now also there are some questions in the human mind. This paper includes the basics of Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, AI in cyber security and many more collected through the survey of different papers.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the continuous development of digitalization, all kinds of data on the Internet have increased rapidly, and knowledge graphs have emerged. Knowledge graphs have become one of the important means for us to manage and utilize knowledge. Knowledge reasoning is part of building a knowledge graph. There are many different methods of knowledge reasoning, which are mainly divided into traditional knowledge reasoning and knowledge reasoning over knowledge graph. The knowledge reasoning manner based on neural network has stronger thinking ability and generalization ability. The inference effect is better. The utilization rate of the relation, entity, attribute and text information in the knowledge base is higher. In this paper, the basic ideas of knowledge graph are introduced in detail. The basic principle of knowledge reasoning is expounded. In addition, from the three dimensions of semantics, structure and auxiliary storage. Three inference methods are introduced. Furthermore, the problems of neural network are summarized, and the challenges of knowledge reasoning are described. Finally, The development prospect of neural network and knowledge reasoning are prospected.},

Pursuing this point of view pays rich dividends. Important concepts like state space, next-state function, termination, fixed points, invariants, traces etc., can be mapped from dynamical systems to elements of algorithm design. Many of these concepts can be visualised through plots that trace the dynamic behaviour of the algorithm.},

  pages={377-380},
  abstract={Recently, there have been several studies on potential application of the ENZ (plasmonic) metamaterials in dielectric waveguides and similar structures at optical frequencies. It was shown possible to tunnel the flow of EM energy trough a slab (or a rod) made out of an ENZ material, transversal dimension of which can be arbitrarily smaller than a wavelength. In addition, one could think of a complementary structure that comprises a dielectric slab embedded within an ENZ metamaterial. Such a structure (a simple air slab with a subwavelength thickness, embedded within an anisotropic ENZ metamaterial) is analyzed in this paper. Numerical results revealed behavior similar to the behavior of an ordinary dielectric waveguide, but with considerably longer guiding wavelength (for a fixed width of a core slab). Numerical results were verified by the measurements on the RF scaled replica of an ENZ waveguide, operating in 4 GHz frequency band.},

This method can be used to represent the expert information and numerical information in the form of if-then rule set. The fuzzy inference system is established to simulate the human thinking, which is used to design LTCC filter. Especially, when there are many the design parameters and the influence of the parameters on the filter is complex, this method can be effective in the design of LTCC filter. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed method, a LTCC filter is designed by using this method. The optimal results are compared with the measured results. It verifies the effectiveness and correctness of the fuzzy algorithm for the design of LTCC filters.},

  abstract={Current research and futuristic approaches including machine learning promise the wide and thorough use of measurement data in assembly processes for analysis and optimization. However, in current assembly lines measurement data is not available in every process, e.g. not in manual assembly processes. In addition, the integration and combination of data from different sources within the assembly line will require huge efforts during the next years. Therefore, a solely data based approach is not suitable for current optimization projects that usually have to react quickly to occurring challenges. Thus, the research project “MessMo - metrologically supported assembly” uses, benchmarks and combines approaches from machine learning and methodic thinking for modelling, cause-effect-identification and optimization. Three approaches for modelling are utilized, accompanied by one approach for data and process optimization.},

  abstract={Due to errors existing in InSAR monitoring results, the filter is adopted for post processing to improve the monitoring results precision. Considering the existent insufficiency of weighted filter and median filter, we proposed a new idea of robust filter by using an equivalent weight, which not only think of regional statistical characteristic fully but also can resist the influence of outliers. Finally, the method is evaluated by a case study of InSAR monitoring results at one region of Xi'an in 2007. The result shows that contour has been improved obviously after treated with filter and the method of robust filter make the effect more obvious.},

  abstract={Big Data Security and privacy are key concerns for cloud computing. At the initial stage, security was not considered for processing Big Data because of insufficient research and adequate security technology. Now researchers have to think new ways for cloud storage and Big Data security to overcome exiting security challenges of Big Data storage. For rapid Big Data processing, encryption is often considered as a big obstacle as clear data processing is much faster than encrypted data. But for cloud system, encrypted data processing is not a big deal because of massive processing power of cloud systems. So encryption will not be an obstacle and degrade the performance to process encrypted Big Data at cloud. There is a big challenge now to store and provide security in small chunk in cloud system and also key management. This paper provides novel approach for Big Data security over cloud namely Secured and High Performance Distributed Big Data Storage (SH-DBDS) model. Data will be split and uploaded for distributed cloud storage system. Single split data will be worthless until and unless joined with the other parts of the data. In this paper, an algorithm has been provided to split and join the data. Experimentation is performed with different data sets (10MB-1GB) at local system and AWS cloud and performance is measured. Evaluation is done considering the security and performance of Big Data.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={In this Hybrid K-Means Clustering for Grouping research work, the k-means methodology is a well-known process for grouping things together. Most of the time, this algorithm sorts the objects into a set number of clusters, but in this case, the user gives the number k. At first, it picks cluster centres at random and measures how far apart k points are. This kind of cluster centre is called k centroids, and it will keep changing until there are no more changes. When making applications that use machine intelligence, a machine should be able to think like a person and make the right choices. In this case, it's not possible to get k-points from the user. So, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search with heuristics to find the initial cluster centres. The goal of this research work is to look at how k-means clustering with GA can be used to optimise. The performance evaluation of hybrid k means method illustrates the precision and accuracy of the selected clustering methods. The result states that precision was 78.35% and its accuracy was 72.67% found while using the approach. The ROC curve analysis is performed with sensitivity and specificity data. The result states that the area under curve of the approach is 84.0%.},

  abstract={The neuronal content of an organism, the individual morphology of each neuron and the variability of these components constitute the atlas of the neurome. The description of such an atlas will be critical in determining the complex neural system of a given organism, eventually providing clues to how animals think and function. As the organisms under investigation scale from the worm to the human, the number of neurons scale from tens to millions. Image analysis is a key ingredient in tackling a neurome for complex organisms. Specifically, two major problems stand between the state of the art and successful automation. First, neurons must be segmented from microscopy, yielding a morphological description of each individual neuron. Second, these neurons must be matched to prototypes and classified by function. This report describes current progress on these two fronts, revealing encouraging progress as demonstrated on the fruit fly Drosophila.},

  abstract={Space-time big data, represented by space-space integration, combines GIS, remote sensing, tilt photography, BIM and Internet of things, and is an important driving force for the development of highway information. However, at present, China’s highway design code still adopts two-dimensional drawings as the design and delivery standards. That leads to the lack of the information management technology for large-scale highway construction based on space-time big data. In order to solve the above problems, this paper expounds the technical framework of spatio-temporal big data, which is composed of geographical modeling, geographical design, geographical monitoring and geographical control, and puts forward some key technologies such as geographical information, BIM and tilt photography, etc., the paper also introduces the experience and thinking of the application of road information technology based on BIM in the design and construction of G30 project, the advantages of applying BIM and GIS to the field of highway engineering design and construction in our country are revealed. Compared with the current highway design and construction management methods, the advantages of the proposed method are the whole process of collaborative work and the efficient control of the whole process. This laid a foundation for the further development of highway information technology and application by combining remote sensing, tilt photography and other advanced technologies.},

For small batch size, the proposed network using TST convolution module outperforms the baseline ST-GCN and the RA-GCN methods in the NTU-RGB+D dataset, showing its efficiency and feasibility.},

  abstract={It is a hot issue of current research that how to strengthen the land use management, so that resources and environmental capacity, land development costs and industrial construction and agricultural production would be spatial balanced to promote regional sustainable development in rapid urbanization and industrialization process. A Case Study in Langfang city of Hebei province was made. Based on equilibrium theory, the evaluation index system of land ecological and land development were made. According to the four principles of the unique highest ecological protection degree, low-benefit subject to high efficiency, land ecological protection would be considered under the higher conditions, land development would be considered under the general conditions, the two-dimensional correlation matrix of the land use ecological protection and development degree was built up in order to realize the land use guide regionalization. Then, in ArcGIS, 100 meters * 100 meters as a unit, land use development and ecological protection index were measured by grid computing and the land use guide regionalization was implemented through index rating-reassignment - grid computing - reclassification process in the study area. The study area was divided into four districts: key development areas, appropriate development areas, appropriate protective areas and key protective areas. Besides, different development strategies were provided for respective development areas. In key development areas, spots - axis development model was choused. In appropriate protective areas, intensive use pattern of development, which means protection of priority and appropriate development, is more reasonable. While key protective areas should adopt the ease with protected mode to strictly control the constructive land development for protecting the ecological services function. The study results show that: 1) the matrix of land use ecological protection-development degree is an effective method of land use guide classification. 2) the calculation results of the land use ecological protection and land use development degree directly affect the classification results. 3) the thinking and contents of the regionalization indices system can be extended.},

  abstract={Many senior citizens stay in a hospital, or they are moved into sheltered accommodation. When they live apart from their family, there is a risk of them suffering from serious disturbance in mental ability including delirium due to stress [1] [2]. Their family can visit hospital or sheltered accomodation and meet senior citizens so as to reduce their stress and prevent them from suffering serious disturbance. However they might not be able to do so due to epidemics. They can communicate with their family as in the case of life when they live in same house by making constant video calls instead of visit. However, they may feel uncomfortable with constant shooting. We feel a need of the system that they can communicate without feeling uncomfortable even if senior citizens live apart from their family. When we came to think of the place where the families lived in comfortably, the living room came to our mind. Family live freely in the living room, spending much of their time without a strong connection each other. But a person can start a conversation at any time by talking to another person, and the conversation will end naturally without clear termination signal. For this reason, we have proposed “Virtual living room system” [3] that had these feature and reproduced a real living room. We made an experimental system in order to verify the validity of the system and conducted experiments that we had subjects live while using it. In the experiment, we confirm the usefulness of the system. However, we also confirm two problems through the opinions of participants. One is the lack of presence. The system displays an icon on the screen that represents the the information of whether person that lives away from the user is in a certain room or not. The icon is not related to the user, so it may not have made the users feel that they live in the same place. The other is the difficulty of setting up for using the system. Setting up this system is not easy for people who are not very familiar with computer operation. The system will actually be used in a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the staff work in would have to set up the system and help the user use it. They may be unfamiliar with computer operation and probably cannot set up the system and use it by theirselves. In this paper, we propose an improved system based on photos that is created in view of the problem and the actual users.},

  abstract={In recent years digital technologies and gadgets have grown so much. Along with other things, the field of Artificial Intelligence has also grown dramatically. Computer vision is one of the most compelling types of AI, which everyone must have experienced in one or the other way like in OCR, Image Recognition, object detection, google lens, etc. One might even come to the assumption that given any image or video to a computer, the computer can understand what’s going on in it and can comment a few things on it, just like WE HUMANS. But that assumption is not yet very true. It may be possible in the future but at the present these need some work to become reality. Leveraging this same motivation, we intend to give some contribution for our dream future to become reality. Recognizing and understanding any arbitrary chess board from the image, thereby digitizing it, is the thing that we will be achieving from the proposed system. Along with all that, giving a comment on the current state of chess board, thereby predicting the next optimal move in the game is another thing which is included in proposed system. Think of a human-like robot trying to play chess. Robots must have something like this in order to play the game. In the proposed research work digitization of Chess Board is done by server application from chess board image acquired by user. Current state of the board is generated and sent back as a response to client application. With the help of GUI, the chessboard is generated from the received Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) on the client side. Depending upon blacks turn or whites turn next optimal move to be played is shown to the user. With our proposed system digital instance is generated with accuracy of over 90%. All blank cells of the board are generated with almost 100% accuracy.},

  abstract={Humans cannot easily manage large stacks of unsorted items&#x2014; think of millions of different items randomly dumped and heaped in a warehouse.<superscript>1</superscript> The usual way for us to deal with a mess is to give it some order; for example, to find a name among one million we typically invest a lot of upfront work to sort all those names alphabetically; that investment pays back each time we look for a name, because then we know in advance where it is, and we don&#x0027;t have to read one million names to find the one we are looking for. The same in mathematics: to handle one million mathematical points we typically inscribe them in an equation, so we deal with just a few lines of algebraic script instead of having to deal with one million coordinates. In applied sciences, as in design, we do not handle dimensionless mathematical points, but physical particles, pixels, or voxels&#x2014;chunks of images and of three-dimensional objects; yet the logic is the same. No human can notate and calculate one billion parts (chunks, pixels, voxels) one by one. Life is too short for that. When dealing with data, simplification is the humans&#x0027; inescapable lot. That&#x0027;s the way our mind works.},

  abstract={During the perceptual learning (PL) of a mobile robot, how to improve the efficiency of its behavior decision is a great challenge. The existing methods suffer from the less flexibility and low efficiency. This article proposes a novel methodology to address these problems. It mimics the principle that the human’s brain can still think, even when he/she neither receives any sensory stimulus nor performs any action, during the off-task process, a gated self-organization mechanism is used to trigger the “brain” of the mobile robot to work, analyze the scenarios that it encountered in the former tasks to decide the best moving direction, then store the sensed scenario information by means of the lateral excitation of the internal neurons in a developmental network (DN), and set up the weight connections from the internal area to high-level decision-making area of the DN. In the following PL, if the robot encounters a similar scenario, it can make a better and faster behavior decision. Therefore, this methodology can greatly enhance the efficiency of behavior decision with the limited training samples, without retraining in facing a new scenario. Most importantly, this methodology makes the robot continuously improve its intelligence through the autonomous learning, even in offline state. Extensive simulation and experiment results of the mobile robot PL demonstrate its potential. Since it is task nonspecific, the same learning principles are potentially suitable for other fields. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial to apply the transfer learning through the lateral excitation mechanism of internal neurons to the robot field with the emergent representation.},

This includes product design, processes and procedures used in industrial settings tools and methods for manufacturing, and product maintenance, repair and overhaul. This paper will cover what is meant by deep digitization, review the thinking that has brought us to where we are today and look at the challenges and options that lay ahead. It will also describe what is meant by industrial transformation and identify the stakeholders and markets involved.The successful adoption of digitization is complex, multidisciplinary, requires systems thinking, and the mastery of a large number of technologies and disciplines. Success is also highly dependent on access to powerful tools, as well as management, organizational, and collaborative structures. Part of this paper will be focused on technology areas that stand out and pose challenges deserving special attention: computational analytics (CA), consisting of optimization methods, modeling, and simulation; artificial intelligence including machine learning; and lastly, data science and data engineering. Standards and common practices are also crucial and no more so than in the collection and dissemination of data within an enterprise and how that data is shared within a larger ecosystem. This paper will additionally describe past attempts at solving this problem and examine possible avenues for creating long-lived data protocols and building blocks for managing and extracting utility from the vast pools of data that can be found in industrial enterprises and the ecosystems they operate in.},

  abstract={Currently, part of the main tasks of digital control information technologies is to recreate a system that thinks logically and intelligently using a computer, and to create devices that make control decision-making like a human under positions of unpredictability and speculative. In this article, the processes of control decision-making in digital control information systems were systematically analyzed and studied. During the analysis of processes control decision-making in digital control information systems, its functions and shortcomings were determined using systematic approach methods. It was the initial stage of a detailed assessment of task positions and the results of statistical models of benchmark for control decision-making were considered. A control decisionmaking rule (master plan) has been developed that allows identifying and choosing the best solutions according to the benchmark and preferences of the control decision-maker. Based on this master plan, an array the most optimal solutions are formed, ranked among the available solutions for the current position. Also, efficiency measures and benchmark are formed, which are used to evaluate the results according to the selected efficiency benchmark and determine the priority level of option solutions corresponding to these results. A model for choosing the optimal solution according to effectiveness measures and benchmark has been developed. In this article, part of the main tasks of digital control information technologies is the creation and calculation of a computer-based information system that thinks logically and intelligently, as well as devices that make human-like control decision-making under positions of unpredictability and speculative. Computational experiments were conducted to solve fuzzy model tasks of control decisionmaking in digital control information systems. Based on the results of computational experiments on task solving, it can be seen that the quality, efficiency and reliability of control decision-making made in digital control information systems are improved.},

  abstract={Computer programming has become an increasingly cross-cutting theme and is no longer considered just a specialized subject. In some countries, the inclusion of this subject in the curricula of the basic cycles of their educational systems has been provided for, because it is recognized that programming promotes computational thinking which allows cognitive development of students. In Chile, the Universidad de La Frontera established that an initial programming course is given to all the Engineering degrees. Unfortunately, studies have shown that students are not achieving the competencies defined by the computational thinking approach. This research paper presents a flexible and systematic teaching framework for developing cognitive skills in programming courses. This framework considers the use of a systematic methodology of teaching programming, which focuses on the process of building solutions over the product; using electronic programmable devices; and sets of pre-defined exercises appropriate to various domains of the engineering area.},

  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  abstract={Many cities and countries are now striving to create intelligent transportation systems that utilize the current abundance of multisource and multiform data related to the functionality and the use of transportation infrastructure to better support human mobility, interests, and lifestyles. Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning. We conclude with lessons learned and future directions, including social transportation, recommender systems, and policy implications.},

  abstract={As a novel framework in classroom teaching, digital games have gained traction. Anyone can play online games, that eventually ascribe potential for large-scale classroom instruction. Digital games have gained popularity in recent years as a way to encourage programming and computational thinking in pre-college (K-12) classrooms. Since the last decade, an ever-increasing number of learners have been drawn by the rapidly expanding areas of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Regardless of the fact that blending of AI/ML and online/digital gaming is a significant and critical subject for classroom pedagogy, there is indeed a paucity of comprehensive literature review in this domain. The aim of this paper is to take cognizance of recent studies and new findings on games that may be used to enhance AI/ML integrated pedagogy for effective curriculum transaction. Relevant articles and games were identified after a thorough exploration and were then included in this qualitative content analysis. This paper presents an overview of important published studies and games, as well as demonstrate how diverse games offer an exceptional and innovative prospect to educate a wealth of concepts and themes in AI and ML.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO® Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO®'s block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO® Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO® Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience.},

  abstract={Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings.},

Many educators believe that in order to achieve this 21st century skills must be taught and that digital literacy should be coupled with rigorous Computer Science principles and computational thinking. Accordingly this work will describe a didactic experience in an introductory programming course by describing the context, pedagogical approach, content of the course based on a procedure-first approach, technologies used, research questions addressed, experimental design adopted, data collection and analysis and the main conclusion supported by qualitative and quantitative data. The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language. However, the high number of errors suggest that using visual programming allows the student to focus on the problem solving activities.},

Despite the initial evidences of enthusiastic participation in such activities, more systematic studies are needed to better understand drivers of students' intentions to participate in programming-based making activities. In this paper, we present an exploratory study which aim to address this issue by examining the interrelations among cognitive (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and affective (i.e., enjoyment) characteristics for both boys and girls. To this end, we build on complexity theory and configuration theory, present a conceptual model, and employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of 105 young students, to identify such interrelations. The findings provide insights on how the examined factors may have a different influence for boys and girls, an outcome that can be used to re-design educational programs targeting maximizing engagement regardless gender.},

  abstract={The development and innovative application of digital research methods in humanities disciplines, characterised as Digital Humanities or e-Humanities, is an established feature of the e-Science and e-Research landscape. Typically these digital methods enable existing research questions to be tackled in new ways, at a scale and speed that transcend manual methods. In this paper we present a different approach to the application of digital techniques to humanities research, a branch of experimental humanities in which digital experiments bring insight and engagement with historical scenarios and in turn influence our understanding and our thinking today. We illustrate this through a series of experiments and demonstrations inspired by the work of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, including simulation of the Analytical Engine, use of a web-based music application, construction of hardware, and reproduction of earlier mathematical results using contemporary computational methods.},

  pages={323-330},
  abstract={In this work, we aim to improve code writing skill in Python-based introductory programming courses for first-year university students. In such courses, students as novice programmers would benefit from personalised and formative feedback to: 1) quickly identify issues in their computational thinking process or coding techniques, and 2) know how to proceed when facing a certain problem. Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback. We report promising results for AP-Coach in the following aspects: 1) quantitative evaluation of code similarity computation and machine translation, 2) qualitative evaluation of the perceived quality and usability of auto-generated feedback, and 3) experience of a selected group of computing students using the system.},

  abstract={Serious games have an already well-known positive impact on students’ motivation and their learning experience. In computer science education a majority of games and approaches exist, that provide engaging environments for students. On the one hand, these can be games related to learning algorithmic thinking but on the other hand, games to learn coding. Besides single-player games, there are also multiplayer games where players compete against each other or collaboratively work on programming tasks. However, many existing multiplayer games offer pre-defined levels where teachers have limited flexibility and individuality for their students. Additionally, many existing game environments use competitive over collaborative approaches. In our project, we extended an existing game by a multiplayer mode where players work together on coding tasks. The game elements support many coding-related concepts but also computational skills such as sequencing, conditionals, loops, and also advanced topics such as concurrency or dependencies using meaningful levels and tasks. However, we conducted an evaluation including 41 participants in three workshops: two in-class activities with secondary school students and an online activity with computer science students. Within these workshops, the students collaboratively worked on coding tasks within the game environment. Thereby, we observed the communication between the students while working on the tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the students’ attitudes towards collaborative learning. We found out that the in-game chat is barely used while in-class activities, especially when the tasks require only low coordination between players. We also found out, that students learn from each other and are more motivated when working together. With our approach, we want to provide educators with a flexible game environment where students can collaboratively improve their coding skills while solving engaging tasks.},

  abstract={This paper presents a web-based distance education system that contains synchronous (live) video lectures, asynchronous learning materials with video-on-demand (VOD) archive data, and question and answer functions through digital reporting between a lecturer and students. It is intended to provide a collaborative workplace to encourage interactions among a lecturer/learners. As such, this environments enables learners to exchange their knowledge and their way of thinking, furthermore, to refine/build the knowledge acquired via lectures. One of the main purposes in our research is to build a flexible e-Learning environment by embedding self/collaborative support functions for the digitized live lectures in order to reinforce much more meaningful knowledge and skills. Moreover, we propose an innovative educational method of a cooperative link between a university and an industry for the higher education. The knowledge repository means a kind of data-warehouse with the computational mechanism to handle/manage various data occurred in e-Learning process. The knowledge repository may be utilized for any information referencing, diagnosing/evaluating of learners' activities, consulting and so on. We also tackle problems of knowledge sharing, knowledge-retrieval and various types of collaboration in the learning environment.

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={2},
  pages={266-281},
  abstract={Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy’s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities. Information entropy can be crucial for evaluating and improving students’ abstraction performance and algorithm efficiency.},

  year={2024},

  pages={30544-30561},
  abstract={In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.},

This paper focuses on female future lower primary school teachers who, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, took an online course on algorithmization and programming, having little or no prior knowledge and skills. The completion rate depended not only on the students' motivation and willingness to learn, but mainly on the content and structure of the course, which was completely modified and made into an online course. The results were more than surprising. The students were able to complete the activities included in the course. Moreover, those activities inspired them to create their own activities, which they may be able to use in their future classes.},

  abstract={The construction industry is a new avenue for big data and data science with sensors and cyber-physical systems deployed in the field. Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field. Our work informs the design of future accessible end-user programming environments for data analysis targeting non-experts.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={2951-2959},
  abstract={Increasing globalization of the world leads to an emerging need for ways to analysis and understand groups from different cultures and ideologies. Researchers have used written text as a medium to examine political discourse and analyze value-motivated groups. Previous works showed that computational linguistic analysis can be performed to infer the flexibility of value-motivated groups from their writings. The main premise of these works is that text can bring insights into individuals' and groups' way of thinking, and potentially, behaviour. While existing works provide viable solutions for characterizing groups' ideological behaviour, they perform their analyses over all text published by the groups. However, researchers have found that religious and value-motivated groups can't be analyzed collectively as they regularly evolve. To address this gap, we analyze the performance of existing methods to single documents. Experimental results show that previous features (e.g., use of pronouns and judgment statements) used to predict groups' flexibility are less predictive for single documents' flexibility. We show that a newly added feature regarding the identity of a group provides a significant contribution to the prediction process. Furthermore, due to the unbalanced nature of our data, we propose a weighting scheme for linear regression based on the inter-group variance. Results indicate that a weighted least squares significantly outperforms a traditional least squares approach. This work brings new insights into the characteristics of different linguistic and performative signals, and their relationship to the linguistic flexibility of groups. It also provides a decision making support tool for practical use by practitioners.},

  abstract={Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.},

  abstract={This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

Creating attractive, social, or hands-on games has already been identified as a possible approach to get teenagers and young adults interested in CS. However, overcoming the global gap between the interest and participation of men and women in CS is still a worldwide problem. To address this challenge, we present a multiplayer game that is used in a workshop setting to motivate girls to program through a 3D game environment. The paper aims to expand the educational landscape within computer science education by offering a motivating and engaging platform for young women to explore programming quests in a collaborative environment. The study involved 235 girls and 50 coaches for the workshop evaluation and a subset of 20 participants for an in-game analysis. In this paper, we explore the engagement in programming and assess the cognitive workload while playing and solving programming quests within the game, as well as the learning experience and the outcome. The results show that the positive outcomes of the workshop underscore the effectiveness of a game-based collaborative learning approach to get girls interested in computer science activities. The variety of solutions found for the different tasks demonstrates the creativity and problem-solving skills of the participants and underlines the effectiveness of the workshop in promoting critical thinking and computational skills.},

It uses a conveyor belt foreign object detection system to detect foreign object. In order to detect foreign object images, a better Nanodet model is suggested. In order to increase detection accuracy while preserving processing speed, the model uses SIoU in place of the original position loss function. When the enhanced Nanodet model is applied to the conveyor belt foreign object detection system, the image of the foreign object appearing on the conveyor belt can be identified. The experimental findings indicate that a conveyor belt foreign object detection system based on an ARM processor and an Android operating system is capable of detecting foreign objects on conveyor belts with an average detection accuracy of 94.3%, a detection speed of 30 frames per second. The application of this method in the detection of foreign objects in conveyor belt can solve the shortcomings of existing methods. At the same time meet the requirements of the conveyor belt foreign object detection site environment.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a robotic cognitive system which can learn itself to do a specific assignment by accumulating experiences through bottom-up thinking to make decision by itself via top-down thinking according to the experiences. That is, the cognitive system has a self-learning ability which can accumulate its experiences to make itself smarter. In essence, the cognitive system possesses a perception model, a memory model, and a hypothesis model. The perception model converts image information into perception codes. The memory model stores experiences in the past and present to provide to the perception model and the hypothesis model. The hypothesis model, which generates the next decision according to the experiences from the memory model, is the most important part of the proposed cognitive system. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we utilize Chinese calligraphy writing tasks by a virtual robot through simulation to evaluate the abilities of the cognitive system. In order to generate the coordinates of the writing brush, we made the virtual robot practice to learn Chinese calligraphy through bottom-up thinking to construct the writing patterns. The illustrative examples in this paper show that the virtual robot can learn to write Chinese calligraphy by top-down thinking according to its own experiences.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a proposal for a series of STEAM activities developing students’ computational thinking, improving their health literacy, and consequently taking care of their own well-being. The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market.},

  abstract={Writing or sketching on whiteboards is an essential part of collaborative discussions in business meetings, reading groups, design sessions, and interviews. However, prior work in collaborative virtual reality (VR) systems has rarely explored the design space of multi-user layouts and interaction modes with virtual whiteboards. In this paper, we present CollaboVR, a reconfigurable framework for both co-located and geographically dispersed multi-user communication in VR. Our system unleashes users’ creativity by sharing freehand drawings, converting 2D sketches into 3D models, and generating procedural animations in real-time. To minimize the computational expense for VR clients, we leverage a cloud architecture in which the computational expensive application (Chalktalk) is hosted directly on the servers, with results being simultaneously streamed to clients. We have explored three custom layouts – integrated, mirrored, and projective – to reduce visual clutter, increase eye contact, or adapt different use cases. To evaluate CollaboVR, we conducted a within-subject user study with 12 participants. Our findings reveal that users appreciate the custom configurations and real-time interactions provided by CollaboVR. We have open sourced CollaboVR at https://github.com/snowymo/CollaboVR to facilitate future research and development of natural user interfaces and real-time collaborative systems in virtual and augmented reality.},

  year={2022},
  volume={69},
  number={5},
  pages={2296-2310},
  abstract={Modern companies are moving rapidly toward more customer-oriented approaches for new product design and development. In real-world applications, customer requirements are more diverse and rather heterogeneous in practice, which requires the targeted market to be multisegmented. In this article, employing the quality function deployment (QFD) and assuming that parameter uncertainty exists, we propose a new fuzzy QFD model for use in multisegment markets, to search for optimal engineering characteristics by maximizing the overall customer satisfaction score. Under that framework, and when the credibility measure is employed, we adopt a fuzzy chance-constrained programming setting to convert the fuzzy model into its crisp counterpart. Afterwards, an analytical method based on fuzzy operational law is proposed to further transform the chance-constrained programming into an equivalent explicit model that can be solved directly by a standard commercial software. For a targeted group of customers, a new yoghurt design is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our treatment. We report that our methodology not only permits the selection of the preferred solution based on an acceptable level of risk, which is very important in practice, but also guarantees higher customer satisfaction scores. This fact extends the fuzzy QFD methodology to a wider range of applications.},

  pages={127967-127986},
  abstract={Cholecystitis is a common disease with a high incidence, and attracts much attention. It not only harms human health, but also affects quality of work and life. Therefore, the choice of a suitable treatment is badly important for patients. In this paper, a novel selection model of treatments for cholecystitis based on hybrid multiple-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), which is helpful to choose the most suitable treatment in the case of asymmetric information between doctors and patients. Subsequently, subjective and objective criteria are comprehensively taken into account in the index system of the selection model for cholecystitis, and combines 2-tuple linguistic with quantitative data analysis. Besides, the evaluation information obtained from the patient's conditions, the treatment and the hospital's medical status, etc., including real numbers, interval numbers, and linguistic labels with multi-granularity, is more complete and real. And the 2-tuple linguistic model is used to unify the non-homogeneous information, so the treatment selection is accurate and reliable. Simultaneously, for the unknown index and criteria weight, the improved entropy weight method and the BWM (best-worst-method) are utilized to figure out the index weight and criteria weight, respectively. Further, TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making model) method based on the prospect theory is applied to solve the prioritization of cholecystitis treatments, and give full consideration to the decision maker of risk aversion. Eventually, an empirical study of treatment selection for cholecystitis is conducted. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis indicate that the proposed selection model of treatments for cholecystitis patients is reliable and effective.},

  abstract={The recent advancements in deep learning techniques and computational power have promoted the development of novel approaches for music generation. In this study, generating alapana, an improvisational form of Carnatic music was proposed, by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Finite State Machines (FSM). The goal is to create melodious alapana sequences that follow a given input Raga, ensuring continuity and coherence throughout the generated musical piece. The proposed approach incorporates Carnatic music theory rules into the generation process to enhance the structural coherence of the generated alapana. Additionally, various hyperparameter settings were explored to achieve the best performance. The Fréchet Audio Distance, Percentage of Correct Pitches and the Subjective evaluation through human listeners are the evaluation metrics of this approach. The result of this study demonstrates the potential of using GANs and FSM for generating continuous and pleasing alapana sequences in Carnatic music, contributing to the growing body of research in computational music generation.},

In this paper, we present our digital compendium of music from the Arab Mashriq and Western Indian Ocean comprising two music collections drawn from Library materials and field recordings at the New York University Abu Dhabi. This is at once the product and object of our ongoing research at the intersection of cultural heritage preservation and computational analysis. Through computational-ethnomusicological research, we explore the cross-cultural similarities, interactions, and patterns from the music excerpts in order to understand their similarity space by employing audio analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Besides the digital artifactual value, pedagogical/educational and scholarly outcomes, we focus on attracting user-friendly and community engagement into appreciating the music from this region. This is done by providing interactive visualizations of the musical features on a dashboard application and 3-D rendering of the mappings in a VR environment. The VR experience is not only immersive but also provides a scope for appreciation, learning, and dissemination of the music from the region.},

  year={1999},

  pages={163-166},
  abstract={The simultaneous switch noise (SSN) problem has traditionally been thought of as an inductance problem. When many drivers on a Si chip switch at the same time, current crowds into the chip ground or V/sub dd/ inductance. Ground bounce occurs proportional to the inductance in the ground or V/sub dd/ lead and the rate of change of current. This line of thinking has been effective at solving SSN problems for lead frame packages. However, packaging has progressed to packages with power and ground planes. Package traces behave more like transmission lines with impedance and delay rather than lumped inductors. The signal waveform rise and fall times are so fast that an edge may fit within the package. Wire bonds have been replaced by solder bumps and peripheral leads have been replaced by solder balls. The new structures may have less than 1% of the inductance of the packages in use just a few years ago. Capacitive and resistive elements have been added to inductance matrices to account for the package time delay and losses, but the number of circuit elements in an SSN analysis and the increased number of simultaneously switching drivers have resulted in large, complex simulation runs that require much CPU time and computer resources. It has become harder to find meaningful model to hardware correlation for large SSN problems. It is time to consider a radically new approach to simulating the SSN problem. This paper looks at treatment of the SSN problem as a power plane bounce problem.},

  abstract={The term ``tacit knowing'' has been much used to denote certain aspects of human knowledge that are only partly verbalizable. The claim which it presupposes, that ``we know more than we can tell,'' has sometimes been taken to imply that mechanistic approaches to the understanding or simulation of human thought are in principle foredoomed to failure. This correspondence argues that a general-purpose goal-pursuing information system, equipped to represent the structure of its world in terms of conditional constraints on action and the planning of action, would automatically show signs of ``tacit knowledge.'' Examples are cited ofmechanistic principles (including the use of interactive elements that combine digital and analog information processing) which would lend themselves to the operation of such a system and would be able to handle information unverbalizable by the system itself. It is suggested that programs seeking to simulate only introspectively verbalizable thinking are methodologically inadequate to represent the full range of human intelligence.},

In the traffic context, the world consists of cars, road networks, traffic lights, etc. Each of these agents controls all traffic lights at a road junction by an observe-think-act cycle. That is, the agent repeatedly observes the current traffic condition at the junction, it then uses this information to reason with condition-action rules to determine how the agent should act in what traffic condition, and finally it performs those actions in order to efficiently manage the traffic flows. We have also developed a NetLogo-based traffic simulator to serve as the agents' world. Our approach is experimented with traffic control of a few connected junctions and the result obtained is promising; it can reduce the average delayed time of each car at each traffic-light near a junction rather substantially when compared with other approaches},

Initially, Computed Tomography scan (CT) and then Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were utilized to discover reasons of dementia in AD patients. This research aims to classify MRI of Alzheimer disease patients into multiple class by using VGG16, ResNet -50 and AlexNet as transfer learning models along with convolution neural networks. There are some stages of AD like mild cognitive impairment, mild Alzheimer’s, moderate Alzheimer’s and severe impairment.

  abstract={A person with mild cognitive disability (MCD), a kind of memory loss that affects both memory and thinking skills, may be at an increased risk of acquiring dementia brought on by Alzheimer's disease or other neurological diseases. MCD affects between 13 and 19% of those who are 60 years of age or older. People who suffer from cognitive abnormalities should seek therapy and diagnosis as soon as they can. The major effect of MCD on the target is its effect on memory. Accurate MCD diagnosis is quite challenging with the current approaches. A hybrid approach is put forward in this study to identify MCD at an early stage. EEG data from MCD individuals and healthy controls was collected for this purpose. With the use of machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and the hybrid approach ACO KNN, Renyi entropy (RE) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) characteristics were retrieved (combined Ant Colony Optimisation with k-Nearest Neighbour). The performance of the system is assessed based on an accuracy comparison with machine learning models. When compared to other models, RE and ACO KNN had an accuracy of 85.0%.},

  abstract={There are increasing research efforts of using GPUs for graph processing. Most prior work on accelerating GPGPU graph algorithms has been focused on algorithm and device-specific optimizations. There is little research on studying high-level programming models and associate run-time systems for graph processing on GPUs, which will be useful to solve diverse real-world problems flexibly. This paper presents a preliminary implementation of a graph framework, GasCL, supporting the well-known “think-like-a-vertex” programming model. The system is built on top of OpenCL and portable across diverse accelerators. We describe our design and use two applications as case studies. The initial performance result shows an average of 2.5× speedup on a GPU compared with a CPU.},

  abstract={In this paper, we describe a method for producing Bangla word clusters based on semantic and contextual similarity. Word clustering is important for parts of speech (POS) tagging, word sense disambiguation, text classification, recommender system, spell checker, grammar checker, knowledge discover and for many others Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Computerization of Bangla language processing has been started a long ago, but still it is in neophyte stage and suffers from resource scarcity. We propose anunsupervised machine learning technique to develop Bangla word clusters based on their semantic and contextual similarity using N-gram language model. According to N-gram model, a word can be predictedbased on its previous and next words sequence. N-gram model is applied successfully for word clustering in English and some other languages. As word clustering in Bangla is a new dimension in Bangla language processing research, so we think this process is good way to start and our assumption is true as our result is quite decent. We produced 456 clusters using a locally available large Bangla corpus. Subjective score derived from the clusters reveal strong similarity of the words in the same cluster.},

  abstract={The changing needs of healthcare provision around the world are forcing service designers and decision makers to adopt new tools in design and evaluation of processes. Apart from the pressure to deliver better services from constrained resources, the increasing use of metrics to monitor and manage care delivery, also means that service providers require a clearer idea of how a service improvement will perform prior to implementation. In turn, this opens up an opportunity for a much greater use of simulation and modeling techniques, provided they can be set within an appropriate framework. This paper discusses and describes a research project aimed at conducting pilot work for developing a framework that facilitates joined up thinking and enables integrative modeling. An approach to achieving such an end is described and progress to date is reported. Since this is an ongoing project, some of the latest results are presented at the conference.},

Some decision making is extremely complex, historically reserved for governing bodies or market places where the collective human experience and intelligence come to play. Other decision making can be trusted to computers that are on a path now into the future through novel software development and technological improvements in data access. In all cases, we should think about this carefully first: what data are really important for our goals and what data should be ignored or not even stored? The answer to these questions involves human intelligence and understanding before the data-to-decision process begins.},

  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={When we design an anti-aliasing low pass filter, it is usually an IIR filter. We need to truncate the filter to an FIR filter. One may think that the more taps there are, the better the image quality is. However, we find that there exists an optimal value of tap number that will give the best visual quality. Filters with larger or smaller number of taps will degrade the image quality, due to the fact that the image contrast is reduced. In this paper we analyze this phenomenon using majorization theory and find that the image contrast can be formulated as a Schur convex function on filter coefficients. We also propose an effective method to choose the best filter so that the image contrast is maximized, so as to give best visual quality.},

  abstract={Nowadays Enterprises are pursuing Digital Transformation to build a new business model and internal processes. Cloud Computing, Big Data, Mobile and Social are top subject and the direction is how to integrate their legacy process and make a convergence to new model. AI and Deep learning technology are rapidly emerged and becoming really critical of new solutions and the solution definitely uses cloud platform by API services and Pre-built assets. It drives API economy growth by global service providers' platform services. API Economy generates a lot of application diversity and platform provides the services, which can support Digital Transformation. Once they build their platform by themselves or 3rd party platform services, they should think about the expansion of their business via the collaboration of business partners. This collaboration model is ecosystem generation to build new partnership. By providing services to business partners they can expand customer who are dealing with business partners. The collaboration of platform service with business partner and the customer will be the new way of enterprise revolution as a part of the 4th industrial revolution.},

  abstract={Geology field trip is an important teaching step for the majors of geology, natural resources prospecting engineering and geographical sciences to learn geology knowledge and grasp field working skills. There are some problems in the traditional geology field trip teaching. Inspired by the Google Maps Street View, the author proposes applying the Image-Based Rendering (IBR), a branch of Virtual Reality (VR), to the field of geology field trip teaching. In this paper, the author designs and implements a panoramic geology field trip system for College of Earth Sciences of Jilin University, in which students can preview the geology field trip location by roaming in the three-dimension (3D) virtual environment. The practice shows that not only can the system help teach 3D thinking, but also reduce the teaching cost, improve students' learning efficiency and enhance learning interest.},

  pages={104-109},
  abstract={Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used methods to provide product recommendation in online stores. The key component of the method is to find similar users or items by using user-item matrix so that products can be recommended based on the similarities. However, traditional collaborative filtering approaches compute the similarity between a target user and the other user without considering a target item. More specifically, they give an equal weight to each of the items which are rated by both users. However, we think that the similarity between the target item and each of the co-rated items is a very important factor when we calculate the similarity between two users. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new similarity function that takes similarities between a target item and each of the co-rated items and the proportion of common ratings into account. Experimental results from Movie Lens dataset show that the method improves accuracy of recommender system significantly.},

  pages={820-824},
  abstract={Stacking model Fusion is a combination classification method for natural language processing and text categorization. Compared to a single weak classifier, model Fusion has the advantage of combining the classification strengths of multiple classifiers, so the combination classifier is often more accurate than a single classifier, and the research of this field has been developed rapidly in recent years, and the combination classifier has been applied in various natural language processing tasks. But only by using the prediction results of the first layer weak classifier to train the second layer classifier, it has a strong limitation, only considers the training of the classification result and ignores the semantic information. We think that the method of training the weak classifier by TFIDF to the document, the expression of the document is not enough, only the information about the frequency of the document and the document is lack of the semantic information of the word2vector. In this paper, a new combination classification method is proposed, which combines the various weak classifiers trained by TFIDF and Word2vector to express the documents in many aspects, and the feature expression can fully utilize the information provided by the document. It has better classification effect than individual word2vector expression and classification and simple weak classifier combination classification.},

  abstract={Small robots are very simple computers that can move autonomously. Their use in primary schools allows pupils to have concrete yet full programming experiences at the age in which Piaget situates the concrete operational stage of cognitive development. Indeed, for their first robotic activities, pupils think of paths where the robot moves forward, decides which direction to go when getting to a crossroad or repeats part of its previous trip. In planning a path for their robot, children walk it themselves thus finding out its successive tangible parts and related features. Our pupils use NQCBaby and NXCJunior programming languages for the formal specification of their robot's behaviour. These are textual languages, mother-tongue-based and Logo-like, in order to be oriented to children rather than to robots. Thus, when programming small robots, children are introduced to a deep computer competence because they deal with the basic blocks of algorithmics (sequence, selection and iteration) and learn how to specify them.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work in Progress tests whether virtual reality (VR) can enhance students’ understanding in scientific fields, specifically Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), when compared to more traditional approaches. Of interest is how VR-based learning activities impact the performance of individuals with experience ranging from none to expert level in MSE compared to paper-based learning activities. To test this, an activity related to crystal structures, similar to what students would see in an introductory level MSE course, was administered to a group of students with varying knowledge levels in MSE. Each participant completed the same worksheet in either VR or on paper. The testing group was composed of seven students, which was too small of a sample size to draw definitive conclusions, yet significant observations could be made. On questions that required recall of prior knowledge, participants using paper-based activities generally performed better, whereas on questions requiring more spatial reasoning and critical thinking, VR participants generally performed better. Most of the participants reported enjoying the VR activities and platform, indicating high usability. These results suggest that VR may be beneficial in teaching complex spatial concepts.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a model-based document information content extraction approach and perform in-depth evaluation based on clients' relevance. Real-world users i.e., clients first provide a set of key fields from the document image which they think are important. These are used to represent a graph where nodes (i.e., fields) are labelled with dynamic semantics including other features and edges are attributed with spatial relations. Such an attributed relational graph (ARG) is then used to mine similar graphs from a document image that are used to reinforce or update the initial graph iteratively each time we extract them, in order to produce a model. Models therefore, can be employed in the absence of clients. We have validated the concept and evaluated its scientific impact on real-world industrial problem, where table extraction is found to be the best suited application.},

  abstract={The author discusses some applications of virtual reality and the limitations of interactivity. He considers how automatic simulated behavior minus the application judgment of direct human participation is already evolving in computer animation. In traditional animation, the animator explicitly controls every action of the characters, provides every cause, and determines every effect. While we think of virtual reality as the ultimate interactive technology, it is likely that only new tasks will be purely interactive. As applications are better understood, the ratio of interactive to automated processing will go down. We can expect anthropomorphic simulated humans to work on simulated projects in not necessarily visible virtual worlds.<>},

  abstract={Node localization is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor network (WSN). Centroid localization algorithm is totally dependent on the density of the size and distribution of anchor nodes, but they distribute randomly and the density of them is small. In view of the traditional centroid localization algorithm is vulnerable to the influence of network deployment status, and the present situation of low positioning precision, put forward an improved centroid localization algorithm. Firstly, put the thinking of weight to the process of node coordinates' calculation, introduce the concept of reference anchor nodes. Then design the weighting strategy accordingly, using the weighted results as the unknown nodes' estimated coordinates, and improve the positioning accuracy through multiple weights. Finally, use simulation experiment to compare the accuracy and stability of the improved algorithm with the classical one. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithm, the improved algorithm's localization accuracy is higher.},

  abstract={As network speed and storage capacities are rising faster and higher, the remote storage and `cloud' concept is gaining momentum and is becoming increasingly popular with personal users as well as business users. At the same time, privacy awareness and business confidentially are important factors in every cloud and data sharing decision. For these and other reasons, the concept of access control models was developed in order to present complete solutions for privacy and confidentiality control in modern systems. Various access controls methodologies have been suggested in the literature, each simplifying and providing flexibility to previous methods. In this paper we will focus on two main methods which are Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each of them, and therefore the need for a novel approach that combines the benefits of these two techniques. We are proposing a different hybrid model and justify how our suggested model and present why we think our suggested model (Policy RC-ABAC) will be more beneficiary in relation to a specific set of needs focusing on flexibility and auditability.},

  abstract={As the resolution of simulation models increases, scientific visualization algorithms which take advantage of the large memory and parallelism of massively parallel processors (MPPs) are becoming increasingly important. For large applications, rendering on an MPP tends to be preferable to rendering on a graphics workstation, due to the MPP's abundant resources: memory, disk and numerous processors. The challenge is developing algorithms that can exploit these resources while minimizing overheads, typically communication costs. This paper describes recent efforts in parallel rendering for polygonal primitives as well as parallel volumetric techniques. It presents rendering algorithms, developed for MPPs, for polygonal, spherical and volumetric data. The polygon algorithm uses a data-parallel approach, whereas the sphere and volume rendering use a MIMD approach. Implementations for these algorithms are presented for a Thinking Machines Corp. CM-5 and a Cray Research Inc. T3D.},

  abstract={Electric vehicles represent a promising choice to decrease pollution and reducing fossil fuel consumption. However, their limited autonomy poses a challenge that prevents them from being suitable for many car users. Several practical solutions are sought to avoid this problem, in particular one may think of enhancing the battery capacity, reducing the charging time, or increasing the frequency of charging points. In this paper, we discuss how these aspects can be integrated by a proper Markov model, thereby offering a neat analytical solution to investigate all these problems. Some preliminary results are also shown to demonstrate the descriptiveness of the model. Further investigation can frame the proposed contribution within an optimization framework, maintaining an analytical context.},

  abstract={Sentiment Analysis is the process of getting people’s ideas on what they think or feel about a particular issue or product or a person and classifying the information expressed about an issue in a positive, negative or a neutral manner. This extracted information can be found very much useful in determining popularity of a person or a product and they are very much useful in ecommerce in suggesting products to buy and in social media like YouTube in suggesting videos to view. Mostly people express their views and share their thoughts in their mother Tongue along with usage of mixed language words is common nowadays. Hence Sentiment analysis of codemixed language plays a major role. There is only little work available in Tamil mixed Sentiment analysis. In order to know the opinion of people who speak Tamil in an effective manner an effective algorithm is needed. Since there are many algorithms available in machine learning and deep learning, this work aims to find sentiment in code mixed words. Deep learning based Bi-LSTM model with ULMFiT Embedding gives more promising results for code-mixed language than other existing algorithms.},

  abstract={Security vendors are facing a serious problem of defeating the complexity of malwares. With the popularity and the variety of malware over the Internet, generating their signatures for detecting via anti-virus (AV) scan engines becomes an important reactive security function. However, AV security products consume much of the PC memory and resources due to their large signature files. AV cloud computing becomes a popular solution for this problem. In this paper, a novel automatic malware signature discovery system for AV cloud (AMSDS) is proposed to generate malware signatures from both static and dynamic aspects. Our experiment on millions-scale samples indicates that AMSDS outperforms most automatic signature generation techniques of both industry and academia. The detection model of malware signature can provides research thinking for anti-virus technology to improve and enhance, especially on detecting and preventing unknown viruses or malware signature.},

  abstract={In recent times, cloud computing has become one of essential computing paradigms. Several companies and organizations that aim of using a cloud computing technology worry about the migration of their work to the cloud computing. This is due to the data security issues where cybercrimes are representing a real problem for them because of the huge damage that can cause. This lead researchers and scientists to thinking about provide new procedures and strategies to fight and trace criminals and attackers. Besides investigating crimes related to the cloud environment in forensically sound manner, the process of performing cybercrime investigation in the cloud environment is known as cloud forensics. This process is facing complex challenges due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing. In this paper, a cloud forensic strategy is proposed for assisting digital investigators and experts for investigation of cybercrimes in effective and efficient manner. The proposed strategy is based on cloud computing platform that providing enormous processing and storage capabilities. This strategy can be as guided to the digital investigators and practitioners to follow it in performing of investigation of cybercrimes.},
