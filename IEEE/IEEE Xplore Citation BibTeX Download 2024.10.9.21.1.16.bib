  abstract={Digital technology, tools, and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been an emerging trend in the design industry for the past two decades. AI is one of the latest computational technology that can mimic human intelligence and is dominating the IT industry at present. A lot of intelligent minds have connected to creating and building more smart and efficient ways of working and distributing creativeness along with the designers and their clients. They are generating the benefits such as design iterations, application of materials and their visualization, optimization of consumed time on projects, and management of information and resources. The area wherein the consumer benefits are within the product or material availabilities, and the reality of their visual perception and personalization within any space. It creates ample ideas based on personal needs and functions. This process consumes less time and makes way for better precision in the construction process with the compatibility of the tools and applications with the production mechanisms. The project working happening beyond 2 dimensions & 3 dimensions with 5D & 6D as in BIM working on multi-dimensional function with real-time extraction of information demonstrating changes in appearance, cost, and work scheduling. Being such a complex phenomenon, these need to be continuously studied as per contextual demands. This study is an assessment and analysis of the utility of these applications in built spaces by different stakeholders and changes in the design-build delivery process. These can benefit and profit designers in ways that can make their work efficient and expand their prolific enhancements in interiors that everyone can use for future studies in the longer run.},

  abstract={This article presents a course that relates environmental education and the development of STEAM skills through the valorization of WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment). As a didactic tool, the BEAM Robots are used, which are simple robots that can be built with elements extracted from WEEE. For the execution of the course, a four-phase curriculum design is developed: propaedeutics, assembly, Computational Thinking (CT), and WEEE. The course is built in a modular way and implemented virtually. The students were evaluated with pre and post-surveys, to investigate the impact of the course. In addition, evaluation activities were created that made it possible to follow the development of the students. In general, it can be concluded that the course had a positive impact on students' STEAM skills and knowledge, as well as an improvement in environmental awareness related to the creative reuse of WEEE.},

  abstract={There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively.},

  pages={1:1-1:11},
  abstract={Creative problems are ill-defined, and thus experimentation, evaluation, and iteration are key elements of creative problem solving. We present a computational theory of evaluation in creative design. Our technique evaluates a design concept by analogically comparing it with alternative articulations of the concept. We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC). We evaluate DESC through computational experimentation across several models to illustrate its strengths and limits and to highlight areas for future research.},

  year={2024},
  volume={29},

  pages={517-528},
  abstract={As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.},

  abstract={Programming has emerged as a crucial educational skill, as its acquisition correlates with the enhancement of students’ reading, writing, creative, computational, and problem-solving aptitudes. This significance is particularly pronounced in a global landscape transitioning into the 4.0 era, characterized by pervasive information technology integration into daily life. This research endeavors to explore the potential of utilizing board games for coding education, specifically targeting student demographics lacking access to modern technology and educational resources, such as ethnic groups or remote populations distanced from urban centers. The board game’s efficacy in augmenting programming comprehension was evaluated through testing and feedback solicited from students and teachers in schools across Chiang Rai Province. Moreover, insights from computer science educators were incorporated to refine gameplay and enrich knowledge components, ensuring adaptability and applicability for future educational contexts.},

  abstract={In most of e-commerce site, evaluation systems are employed to evaluate each user after the tradings. Normally, seller's evaluation score is shown in e-commerce site that is computed based on score given by buyers. In recent e-commerce site, the evaluation is based on multiple attributes and buyers give their thinking for each attribute. In this viewpoint, the seller evaluation in e-commerce is collected knowledge from buyers and synthetic score is computational intelligence because each buyer makes his/her decision whether he/she trades with the seller. In this paper, we discuss the computational intelligence of evaluation system in e-commerce. Then, to avoid asymmetric and incomplete information in tradings, we design a mechanism of trader evaluation. After that, we give some experiments to show the rate of successful trade in our proposed mechanism. Contributions of this paper are showing theoretical discussion of e-commerce computational intelligence, design on evaluation mechanism and showing the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract={The increasing interest in understanding the behavior of biological neural networks, and the expanding utilization of artificial neural networks in different fields and scales, both require a thorough understanding of how technological computing works. However, von Neumann in his classic "First Draft" warned that it would be unsound to use his suggested paradigm to model neural operation, furthermore that using "too fast" processors vitiates his paradigm, which was intended only to describe (the timing relations of) vacuum tubes. Thus, it is worth scrutinizing how the present technology solutions can be used to mimic biology. Some electronic components bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining them using different principles can result in systems with inferior efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional computing principles, components, and thinking about computing limit mimicking biological systems.},

  abstract={EarSketch lowers the barriers to entry and broadens engagement in computer science through expressive and culturally relevant music composition. In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.},

  abstract={In patient monitoring fuzzy-based evaluation can be used advantageously, because of its characteristics. This approach can work with input factors, for which sharp limits cannot be defined and it can handle uncertainties, subjectivity in the data as well as the evaluation process. The conventional Mamdani inference is the most suitable method, because it helps to build a model, which is much closer to human thinking, but its computational needs are very high, due to the complex-shape functions. This paper introduces a flexible patient monitoring system optimization, where the input functions can be tuned according to the personal statistics. Modified versions of the Mamdani inference are applied in this system, which can reduce computational complexity, while they retain the advantages of the original method.},

  title={Incrementalization of Vertex-Centric Programs}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1019-1029},
  abstract={As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.},

  title={Novelette, a Usable Visual Storytelling Digital Learning Environment}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={168850-168868},
  abstract={Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.},

  abstract={Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of "extremeness". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes the applicability of the task programming model in the parallelization of generic wave front problems. Computations on this type of problems are characterized by a data dependency pattern across a data space, which can produce a variable number of independent tasks through the traversal of such space. Precisely, we think that it is better to formulate the parallelization of this wave front-based programs in terms of logical tasks, instead of threads for several reasons: more efficient matching of computations to available resources, faster start-up and creation task times, improved load balancing and higher level thinking. To implement the parallel wave front we have used two state-of-the art task libraries: TBB and OpenMP 3.0. In this work, we highlight the differences between both implementations, from a programmer standpoint and from the performance point of view. For it, we conduct several experiments to identify the factors that can limit the performance on each case. Besides, we present in the paper a wave front template based on tasks, template that makes easier the coding of parallel wave front codes. We have validated this template with three real dynamic programming algorithms, finding that the TBB-coded template always outperforms the OpenMP based-one.},

The cognitive engine is in charge of implementing the functionality of a cognitive system. Nowadays, cognitive engines are used as a self-organized management mechanism in different fields such as computer networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics. This is because the management algorithms of these fields are going to be very complex and therefore human thinking models as digitalized models are required for fast and accurate decision making. In this paper, we summarize challenges in designing cognitive engines. Then, a set of challenges in designing the cognitive engine for body-mind operating system in the digitalized healthcare system is obtained.

  abstract={John Clark was inventor of the Eureka machine to generate hexameter Latin verse. He labored for 13 years from 1832 to implement the device that could compose at random over 26 million different lines of well-formed verse. This article proposes that Clark should be regarded as an early cognitive scientist. Clark described his machine as an illustration of a theory of “kaleidoscopic evolution” whereby the Latin verse is “conceived in the mind of the machine” then mechanically produced and displayed. We describe the background to automated generation of verse, the design and mechanics of Eureka, its reception in London in 1845 and its place in the history of language generation by machine. The article interprets Clark's theory of kaleidoscopic evolution in terms of modern cognitive science. It suggests that Clark has not been given the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of computational creativity.},

  abstract={This concept of evolvable, process-oriented modular systems may be viewed as a new business model to sustain European competitiveness in micro and mini assembly. It is clear that this business model implies a high dynamic lifecycle for shop floors. The system will move from a static life cycle since the modules that create the different systems will live beyond the product lifecycle. This dynamicity imposes strong requirements on the way systems are designed, installed, operated, and reengineered. Re-configurability is not enough. These requirements will not only have an impact on the individual control architecture of the modules but also on, and this is very important, how the system is created, and several types of co-existing architectures},

At present, the development of artificial intelligence in various fields is getting better and better, and the artificial intelligence information technology is slowly beginning to converge towards the auditing field. The blockchain storage application system requires each node to store a complete data, causing waste of the storage resources; at the same time, it does not make full use of the network routing traffic resources. Based on this background, this paper proposes the novel AI and BC based intelligent system for the audit internal control. The system is designed and validated through the simulation. The proposed intelligent system can improve the overall efficiency.},

  abstract={The K-12 ICT (Information and Communication Technology) curriculum in Taiwan faced many changes in last two decades. In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.},

  pages={1463-1477},
  abstract={Spreadsheet-based tools provide a simple yet effective way of calculating values, which makes them the number-one choice for building and formalizing simple models for budget planning and many other applications. A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={116011-116025},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.},

Most of the research carried out in this specific area has shown advances in Modelling and efficiency of story generation. However, some of the setbacks in Artificial Story Generation include little to no coherency with human generating pattern, tokens/words limitation, missing plot twists and direction of story.

  abstract={Computer science as a discipline encompasses the study and creation of computational techniques for problem-solving. Unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. A considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. This paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. In the proposed architecture, a core lecture is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitation/laboratory sections. The focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. The recitation/laboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. The objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking.},

The system has two core building blocks: (1) Data analysis combining several statistical and machine learning models, founded under different principles and assumptions, into a single meta-model for predicting compliance behavior. The aim is to create superior models for behavior prediction - knowledge that can then be translated into patient-centered decision-support tools. (2) Incorporating data analysis and visualization enabling datasets to be turned into knowledge utilities that can intelligently interact with participants by alerting them to any interesting correlations within the data. Such tools could provide feedback indicating, for example, a high-risk to medication non-compliance behavior in which case appropriate resources could be directed to those who need help the most.},

It focuses on the microscopic structure of water and explores, among others, concepts related to atomic and molecular orbitals. To evaluate that software, we have made a qualitative study with 20 first-year students of science and engineering courses at the university of Coimbra, Portugal. Having been asked to describe their views about how they conceive electrons in an atom before seeing "Virtual Water", students revealed some misconceptions. We have tried, with partial success, to overcome them by making students explore our virtual environment.},

  abstract={The Black Box is a system with the internal organization and behavior about which the observer has no information. However, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs. The paper is concerned with the implementation of “black box” type of activities to teach computational thinking. The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution. We found out that a lot of the students were not able to think about the concept of the application functioning and were not able to create any formal description of algorithms.},

  abstract={The human mind is a truly remarkable thing that does so much that we are not even aware of. Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way to a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects. Using BCI to control a drone will open the way toward smooth and high-response flight. Deep learning is a new-age skill that has made many breakthroughs and influenced modern technologies. It has made it possible to predict and identify even the most complex and abstract patterns that even we humans would be very challenged to catch ourselves. In this paper, a method of controlling a drone using BCI has been presented using an 8-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Deep learning has been employed to process and classify human brain waves. After testing the resulting deep learning algorithm, the overall classification accuracy was 90% to distinguish between four different movements of the drone.},

  abstract={Computer Science contains many abstract concepts, which are both difficult to teach, and to comprehend. Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.},

  abstract={The system aims to direct the user to create their network system collaboratively for a case of Covid-19 health throughout a case study in a Web System and E-Commerce course. The framework of directed health learning is based on 7x2C content knowledge established criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The self-design frame framework is plan-oriented and based on the concept of a plan and plans integrations and special relationships. The user is directed to break the system into plans and the design is to self-guide the user to build a system to comprehend, combat, coexist, cope, and trace COVID-19 with four layers of diagnostics, simulation, and pattern matching database. With the collaboration of users' systems, a fact from one user as output can be transferred to another user as an input in a circulation forming a general fact. Consequently, the transfer of learning from one system flows into another system resulting in a pattern to be found. Based on the pattern an algorithm will formulate to tackle a solution to COVID19. The implication of this study will be a guideline for others to initiate their own participant's system to find a pattern and formulate an algorithm for the pandemic. The idea of self-design and self-directed learning can be transferred to other fields of study covid-19 health. At present time, a parallel case study of goods and services on farming of Sunchoke plant has been directed with three plan themes of Grow, Eat, and Heal.)},

  abstract={In present study the fractal theory has been reviewed in the context of bio-functional and biomedical complex systems. The chaotic approach is a critical component of the theoretical framework and can be used in analyzing complex biological structures such as chromatin structures. Fractality is a metric of complexity in biological functions; it is an indicator of the complication level of the self-similar structure, while chaos is a sort of dynamic behavior that usually produces totally arbitrary patterns. Fractal measurements in vivo could be used to predict the efficiency of painful therapy. The fractal technique can be used to assess carcinogenesis, tumor progression, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment with the convergence of modern sensing techniques in nano-scale spectroscopic techniques, which is a prospective biomarker. The mathematical principles of fractals and chaos in biological systems are presented in the context of the condition of health treatment and their significance. Fractality in different biological functions including the heart has now been investigated and measured the dosing quantity with chaos and fractal level. As excessive amounts of chaos and fractal complexity are harmful to biological predictions. For biological applications, chaos analysis may be advantageous. This paper is a review which highlights the fractal and chaos theories for biological functions and biomedical systems. The focus will be to explore biological functions, due to its computational machine learning-based demands and capability in mathematical complexity.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={21-27},
  abstract={The ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar plays an important role in surveillance, precision tracking, and classification of ground moving targets. The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.},

  pages={814-818},
  abstract={In this paper, we compare and analyze the prediction performance of existing ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) models. The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant.},

  abstract={Color harmony is an important factor affecting the aesthetic feeling of images and plays an important role in visual perception. It can evaluate the feasibility of images by constructing the computational model of human aesthetic thinking. In this paper, a color harmony evaluation method based on color complexity was implemented. Given the classical color harmony model which is suitable for the simple color combination but not suitable for the complex image, and the local feature redundancy caused by grid sampling, an adaptive sampling based on CCM(color complexity measure) was implemented. Then, K-means was adopted to extract local color harmony features. Finally, a model was constructed between local color harmony features and the overall color harmony by SVM. The results show that the method implemented in this paper can represent the color harmony of complex images accurately and effectively.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a model for the generation of ideas within a creative thinking/brainstorming context. In the model, ideas emerge as conceptual combinations from the interaction of complex dynamics at several semantic levels: features, concepts, categories, and previously generated ideas. This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system. We also briefly describe a computational model for ideation in groups using a multi-agent formalism. The initial focus of this model is on studying the potential benefits of cognitive diversity in agent groups, e.g., the presence of convergent and divergent thinkers, or agents with different semantic organizations.},

In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.},

  abstract={The "Bebras" is an international large scale contest that aims to motivate children for engaging in Computer Science. In this paper we present an investigation of the psychometric factors that determine the success in this contest, e.g. Abilities in Computational Thinking or intelligence factors. For this purpose, we looked for subsets of Bebras questions that are requiring joint psychometric constructs, according to the responses of the test persons, applying latent trait analysis on all combinations of questions. After identifying suitable sets of questions, we tested the fit of the mono-parametric Rasch Model and evaluated the distribution of person parameters. Additionally, the identified sets of questions were analyzed by qualitative methods to find out the nature of these common psychometric constructs. As a test bed for feasibility studies, we have chosen the Bebras Contests of Germany 2009. We have found and analyzed several sets of questions that met our requirements, analyzed the questions, and identified differences in the performance of boys and girls in these sets.},

  abstract={Some researchers consider that the benefits of Computational Thinking (CT) in education are unclear, and therefore a quantitative study to understand the effects of CT skills in the basic levels of formal education is needed. The present study aims to analyze the effects of CT on the academic performance of students in high school. We seek to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Can CT increase the problem-solving skills of students in high school? (RQ2) Is CT related to the performance of students in high school? (RQ3) Can CT improve the performance of students in high school? We conducted an analysis between two groups of students with similar profiles belonging to the same population, where the factor CT proficiency is the only feature that distinguishes both groups. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between the performance of evaluated students and their skills of CT developed by computer programming. In addition, we found that students proficient in computer programming have superior performance up to 10.2% in ENEM (National Exam of High School) assessment compared to those with little or no experience level and even better performance 21% in the WASI test problem-solving in students on attending high school.},

  abstract={This research full paper characterizes the literature on academic initiatives to foster computational thinking and programming (CT&P) in Brazilian K-12 education. Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CT&P in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CT&P in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper investigates the effect of Computational Thinking (CT) and robotics on learning mathematics. CT involves problem-solving skills based on Computer Science concepts. However, there is no CT formal definition as well as information on how to integrate it with other high school subjects. Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.},

  year={2021},

  pages={748-754},
  abstract={This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.},

  abstract={In the past, many investigations focused on the impact of programming skills towards learning computational thinking (CT). However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.},

  abstract={Collaborative learning in higher education, such as the emerging makerspaces, has contributed to research on innovation and participant expertise. However, there is little research on knowledge management in makerspaces or how learners transfer their individual tacit knowledge in the collaborative space. In addition, the functionality of maker education to promote individualized and personalized learning still needs to be explored. This study is based on Chinese STEM graduate students’ experiences with project-based learning in a Maker Education environment to test how AIGC tools help to acquire and transfer students’ individual tacit knowledge. The sample was formed from 266 MPhil students taking the "Design Thinking and Effective Academic Communication" course in their first academic year at the world’s first interdisciplinary university in southern China. The AIGC teaching intervention was based on the four-phase knowledge management model. In a cycle of socialization-externalization-combination-internalization,learners first explore expertise in a research area in project teams and formulate their research interest. Then, storytelling, analogy, and metaphor data were first used to assess students’ abilities to communicate their research topic in text and images on an A4 paper. The subsequent AIGC-supported instructional intervention consisted of 20-minute instructional Sprints with two instructors from Computational Media Arts and Academic Communication over two consecutive weeks. The students’ work shows that combining AIGC tools allows for a higher quality of visualization of tacit knowledge in the combination phase -.},

  abstract={Advanced engineering uses highly integrated modeling that serves product development and application for lifecycle. In the course of a group work, communication between engineers is done increasingly through complex product model. This paper analyzes this new function of product model and recognizes that current product models can not provide for its efficient support. In this context, poor representation of decision background is considered as main cause of the communication shortage. As a possible contribution to better communication, the author proposed a new information content based extension to currently prevailing product model in the form of a new sector. This paper introduces and discusses a new development in the above mentioned extension in order to establish a contextual chain of model entities from human intent, through objectives for product and contextual connections to decisions. The proposed new method is devoted to enhance current professional product modeling on the way towards human defined, company related, verified, and authorized and responsible engineer controlled intelligence of engineering modeling. Paper starts with an introduction and evaluation of the above cited information content based extension to currently prevailing product model. Following this, the proposed new contextual modeling of background of decisions on engineering objects is discussed. This modeling provides support for decision making at the application of product model and collecting experiences and methods for similar problems in the future. As the main part of the paper, new contextual content entities are proposed. Finally, some words are devoted for future plans of research in the proposed intelligent engineering method.},

  abstract={This paper arises from work ongoing in the GALA (Games and Learning Alliance - Network of Excellence for Serious Games). As part of GALA, a comprehensive state of the art analysis of existing serious games for the business and industry domain (loosely defined) was undertaken. A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The "simulation level" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.},

  abstract={This paper describes results from a project in an undergraduate engineering physics course that coupled classroom use of interactive computer simulations with the collection of real-time formative assessment using pen-enabled mobile technology. Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.},

  abstract={Engineering for the development, application, and recycling of products is recently supported by fully integrated model of product. Prototyping is moving to virtual by the application of sophisticated product models for complex simulations. Simulations rely upon knowledge representing experience, expertise and intelligence of engineers in knowledge wares. Increasing proportion of this knowledge is placed in the product model in the form of active rules, checks, and reactions. In case of any change of these knowledge representations, relevant product model entities are modified accordingly. This knowledge must be verified by practice. Consequently, interaction of virtual and physical worlds is anticipated as a main area for future research in product model based virtual engineering systems. The authors developed and published a novel knowledge based method for the definition of product objects during the recent years. In this paper, they conceptualize a possible integration of intelligent sensor networks with active knowledge in product models. They propose introduction of physical information space in order to receive engineering object related information from preprocessed sensor data. The proposed novel method is based on intelligent capabilities both in sensor and product modeling.},

  pages={117-122},
  abstract={Two main recent achievements of the first decade in this new century in model space based during product definition are representation of corporate knowledge in product model and extended application of contextual feature principle. Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.},

  abstract={In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.},

  abstract={Artificial neural network (ANN) community is engaged in biological plausibility issues these days. Different views about this subject can lead to disagreements of classification criteria among ANN researchers. In order to contribute to this debate, two of these views are highlighted here: one is related directly to the cerebral cortex biological structure, and the other focuses the neural features and the signaling between neurons. The model proposed in this paper considers that a biologically more plausible ANN has the purpose to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities, including learning processes, of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models upon which the proposed description is based takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and inter-neuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses. Also, the duration of action potentials is taken into account. In addition to the characteristics for encoding information regarding biological plausibility present in current spiking neuron models, a distinguishable feature is emphasized here: a combination of Hebbian learning and error-driven learning.},

  abstract={Dance choreography is an intense, creative and intuitive process. A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities. Though it is not impossible, the choreographer being human cannot explore, analyze and remember all these variations among steps due to large scale of available options. Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count. The details of experimental study performed for the Genetic Algorithm based art to SMart (System Modelled art) system along with the results obtained are also presented in this paper.},

This research attempts to answer the question and tries to determine what factors can affect an employee to become a chief and capable to achieve performance target. To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees. If organization wants to select potential employees to become chief and predicts them achieving their target, classification techniques should include all employees as the population and avoid to choose only subsets to ensure the confidence of result. Meanwhile, KL-Divergence function generates competencies that affect employee who become a chief and achieve the target. They are achievement orientation, adaptability, analytical thinking, communication and information seeking.},

  abstract={The cloud model is good at bridging the gap between qualitatives and quantities, and so it was applied to evaluating mildew degree of rice seeds based on machine vision. A symmetric cloud and two asymmetric clouds were designed to express three qualitative concepts and the relationship between them. These three qualitative concepts represent different mildew degree including non-mildew, spot mildew and severe mildew. The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way. An experiment was conducted to test on the classifier based on cloud and another classifier based on neural network. The results showed that the classification accuracy of cloud classifier was higher than the classification accuracy of neural network.},
