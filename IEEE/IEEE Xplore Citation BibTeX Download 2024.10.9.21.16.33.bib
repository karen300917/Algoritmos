  abstract={Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.},

  pages={113199-113212},
  abstract={The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={114},
  number={4},
  pages={114-127},
  abstract={In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS.},

  abstract={Advancement in wireless transmission has enabled the communication among multiple devices all over the world, as well as expanding the frontiers of wireless Internet access. As a result of these advancement, numerous devices are questing for wireless connectivity thereby congesting the existing spectrum. If new measures are not taken to reduce depletion of the reserved radio resource, new allocations of wireless Internet access will be impossible, thereby risking the development of the entire wireless ecosystem. The demands for resourceful spectrum consumption have continually driven researchers and stakeholders in the wireless industry to search for spare radio spectrum to offer affordable and reliable wireless connectivity. The TV broadcasting is not fully utilizing the spectrum in some geographical zone. These TV unused spaces called TV White Spaces (TVWS), are well-thought-out to be the probable future resolutions for unavailability of spectrum. The low frequency band (470 to 694 MHz) of the unutilized TV channel has exceptional broadcast features over extensive distances and enables transmissions through high-rise buildings, trees, and mountains. These features allow the applications of TVWS in Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor network, wireless connectivity, wireless switching, smart grid and cities, automated transportation, and logistics as well as connectivity in cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a study on the advantages and benefits of television white space as an alternative to wireless broadband connectivity.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are ubiquitous in our modern world, from the cars we drive to the homes we live in. CPS are integrated systems that combine computational and physical components to perform complex tasks. As CPS become increasingly sophisticated and interconnected, it is important for students to have a basic understanding of how they work and how to use them safely and responsibly.In this work, the need for CPS education, the requirements from the teaching faculty and students, the course design methodology and its intent and a 20-hour lesson plan for CPS education is proposed along with a methodology to teach an introductory module on safety and security. CPS education in pre-university education should be comprehensive and hands-on, with an interdisciplinary approach, emphasis on safety and security, real-world applications, and integration of emerging technologies. This education will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological world while being aware of the trust, safety and security aspects in designing and using the CPS interface. The proposed method was implemented in an undergraduate program as an elective course and its observations are presented.},

  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in optimizing cumulative rewards, and it provides policies that account for how the system will interact over the future with the agent. However, when more than one learning agents are present, developing efficient collaborations/interactions is a challenging issue; not every agent may have access to the same amount of information and computational resources; not every agent may make the same assumptions about the decision-making mechanisms of one another; and many agents may not even be aware of the existence of other agents. These cognitive and physical limitations can be seen as a form of bounded rationality. Several recent experimental and empirical studies have found that the initial responses of decision-makers in multi-player games are often far from the equilibrium, which is very often out-predicted by structural non-equilibrium (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) models. This is because non-equilibrium play models allow for players who are boundedly rational and have limited information, so that their policy is not necessarily a best response to the actual adjustment laws of other agents. This tutorial talk will present computationally and communicationally efficient approaches for decision-making in boundedly rational stochastic games. Motivated by the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose non-equilibrium strategies, two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning will be described. In the first model, named level-k thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs, and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, this tutorial talk will present both a level-recursive as well as a level-paralleled algorithm, where the latter can have an overall reduced computational complexity. For more information please see the main tutorial paper [1].},

  abstract={A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.},

  abstract={This study seeks to develop a model that would facilitate professional skill development in aeronavigation system operators by considering the neurophysiology that underlies the formation and development of functional systems. A key role is played by motivation which is realized by electrochemical processes in synapses. We present a model of synapse formation in the process of learning. A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.},

  abstract={No system in the real world can compute an appropriate response in reaction to every situation it encounters, or even most situations it is likely to encounter. Biological systems address this issue with four strategies: (1) a repertoire of already computed responses tied to a situation recognition process, (2) organized in a response-time hierarchy that allows a quick response to occur immediately, and one or more slower and more deliberate responses to begin at the same time, with (3) decision processes that allow one of them to take over after a little while, or that (4) merge several of them in a combined and possibly novel response. In this paper, we describe an approach to building self-adaptive computing systems that incorporates these strategies, to cope with their intended use in hazardous, remote, unknown, or otherwise difficult environments, in which it is known a priori that the system cannot keep up with all important events, and that “as fast as possible” is not appropriate for some interactions. The key to implementing these strategies is an abstraction/refinement hierarchy of behavioral models and processes at multiple levels of granularity and precision. The key to coordinating these different models is the collection of integrative mappings among them, which are developed along with the models, and used for managing system behavior. We also describe the system development process that we use to build such systems, which differs from conventional methods by taking the basic artifacts of development, considered as partial models of aspects of the system in its environment, and retains them all in a model hierarchy, which eventually becomes the definition of the run time system. We show how to implement such systems, explain why we think they are good candidates for real-time operational environments, and illustrate the method with an example implementation.},

  abstract={Recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have provided us with neural networks capable of creating images of astonishing quality, be they realistic, abstract, or even creative. These models have in common that (more or less explicitly) they all aim to produce a high-quality one-off output given certain conditions, and in that they are not well suited for a creative collaboration framework. Drawing on theories from cognitive science that model how professional designers and artists think, we argue how this setting differs from the former and introduce CICADA: a Collaborative, Interactive Context-Aware Drawing Agent. CICADA uses a vector-based synthesis-by-optimisation method to take a partial sketch (such as might be provided by a user) and develop it towards a goal by adding and/or sensibly modifying traces. Given that this topic has been scarcely explored, we also introduce a way to evaluate desired characteristics of a model in this context by means of proposing a diversity measure. CICADA is shown to produce sketches of quality comparable to a human user’s, enhanced diversity and most importantly to be able to cope with change by continuing the sketch minding the user's contributions in a flexible manner.},

In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development},

  abstract={We introduce the novel problem of automatically generating animated GIFs from video. GIFs are short looping video with no sound, and a perfect combination between image and video that really capture our attention. GIFs tell a story, express emotion, turn events into humorous moments, and are the new wave of photojournalism. We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual and elaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generated GIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates a ranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train our model to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over 100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectively deal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in the ranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picks up several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs. On our new large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the advantage of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={A Thorough Trust and Reputation Based RBAC Model for Secure Data Storage in the Cloud}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={30},
  number={4},
  pages={778-788},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a widespread technology, which has attracted much attention nowadays. Among the many criteria that must be considered for data storage in the cloud, access control plays a vital role. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a well-known technique for secure data storage in the cloud. Since the traditional RBAC models are improper for open and decentralized environments, recently, some works have integrated the trust concept into the RBAC model. Nevertheless, they have not fully addressed the required security metrics of a trust-based system. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce the security goals that should be considered in an efficient trust-based system. Second, we propose a novel trust and reputation based RBAC model that not only can properly withstand the security threats of trust-based RBAC models, but also is scalable as it has reasonable execution time. Third, we evaluate the proposed model using the famous trust network of advogato dataset. Eventually, we compare the proposed model with recently-published ones in terms of mean absolute error, execution time of indirect trust computation, and provided features. The achieved results are indicative of the priority of the proposed model to be employed in real cloud environments.},

  abstract={Social engineering is a real threat to industries in this day and age even though the severity of it is extremely downplayed. The difficulty with social engineering attacks is mostly the ability to identify them. Social engineers target call centre employees, as they are normally underpaid, under skilled workers whom have limited knowledge about the information technology infrastructure. These workers are thus easy targets for the social engineer. This paper proposes a model which can be used by these workers to detect social engineering attacks in a call centre environment. The model is a quick and effective way to determine if the requester is trying to manipulate an individual into disclosing information to which the requester does not have authorization for.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a realistic model to investigate the cascading failure process in a cyber-physical power system (CPPS) which can be topologically modeled as an interdependent system consisting of a power network and a cyber-network. To evaluate the robustness of CPPS against cyber-attacks, we take into consideration the effects of computer malware spreading, power redistribution and overloading, and the interdependency between the coupled networks, and then adopt the stochastic failure model to calculate the time interval between the initial cyber-attack and a given level of power loss. We conduct a critical node analysis on the power network to identify the important buses whose removals are likely to trigger a serious blackout. Based on the results of the critical node analysis, we propose both deterministic and stochastic coupling strategies for an asymmetric CPPS with two subnetworks with unequal sizes, to improve its robustness against both random and intentional cyber-attacks. The simulation results on CPPSs built on IEEE 118 Bus and 300 Bus power systems indicate that the proposed coupling methods can effectively improve the system robustness against cyber-attacks.},

  title={Heavy Hitters via Cluster-Preserving Clustering}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={61-70},
  abstract={In the turnstile ℓp heavy hitters problem with parameter ε, one must maintain a high-dimensional vector x ∈ ℝn subject to updates of the form update (i,Δ) causing the change xi ← xi + Δ, where i ε[n], Δ ∈ ℝ. Upon receiving a query, the goal is to report every "heavy hitter" i ∈ [n] with |xi| ≥ ε ∥x∥p as part of a list L ⊆ [n] of size O(1/εp), i.e. proportional to the maximum possible number of heavy hitters. For any pε(0,2] the COUNTSKETCH of [CCFC04] solves ℓp heavy hitters using O(ε-p lg n) words of space with O(lg n) update time, O(n lg n) query time to output L, and whose output after any query is correct with high probability (whp) 1 - 1/poly(n) [JST11, Section 4.4]. This space bound is optimal even in the strict turnstile model [JST11] in which it is promised that xi ≥ 0 for all i ∈ [n] at all points in the stream, but unfortunately the query time is very slow. To remedy this, the work [CM05] proposed the "dyadic trick" for the COUNTMIN sketch for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model, which to maintain whp correctness achieves suboptimal space O(ε-1lg2 n), worse update time O(lg2 n), but much better query time O(ε-1poly(lg n)). An extension to all p ∈ (0,2] appears in [KNPW11, Theorem 1], and can be obtained from [Pag13]. We show that this tradeoff between space and update time versus query time is unnecessary. We provide a new algorithm, EXPANDERSKETCH, which in the most general turnstile model achieves optimal O(ε-plog n) space, O(log n) update time, and fast O(ε-ppoly(log n)) query time, providing correctness whp. In fact, a simpler version of our algorithm for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model answers queries even faster than the "dyadic trick" by roughly a log n factor, dominating it in all regards. Our main innovation is an efficient reduction from the heavy hitters to a clustering problem in which each heavy hitter is encoded as some form of noisy spectral cluster in a much bigger graph, and the goal is to identify every cluster. Since every heavy hitter must be found, correctness requires that every cluster be found. We thus need a "cluster-preserving clustering" algorithm, that partitions the graph into clusters with the promise of not destroying any original cluster. To do this we first apply standard spectral graph partitioning, and then we use some novel combinatorial techniques to modify the cuts obtained so as to make sure that the original clusters are sufficiently preserved. Our cluster-preserving clustering may be of broader interest much beyond heavy hitters.},

  year={2021},

  pages={386-401},
  abstract={Several models have been developed to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, and how it could be contained with nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing restrictions and school and business closures. This article demonstrates how evolutionary AI can be used to facilitate the next step, i.e., determining most effective intervention strategies automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription, it is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact. Early experiments suggest that workplace and school restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. They also demonstrate that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and suggest creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g., by alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future pandemics.},

  abstract={Capturing and retaining the attention of students while learning complex topics like modeling and simulation is a critical task. In discrete-event simulation (DES), educators rely on examples like queueing systems in fast food restaurants or manufacturing organizations to provide the necessary context for learning. In many instances, these examples fall short in capturing the attention of students, especially at the middle and high school levels. One approach for learning complex topics, like creating simulations, is through gaming. This paper reports on the creative use of regular simulation tools to develop simulation games with entertainment content aimed towards engaging young learners. Two games are presented: one focuses on the use of decision nodes while the second focuses on the use of batch/separator nodes. As part of future work, we propose to use these games to evaluate how much knowledge transfers from an entertainment context to one using simulations for real-life situations.},

  pages={15450-15460},
  abstract={Since the rise of vision-language navigation (VLN), great progress has been made in instruction following - building a follower to navigate environments under the guidance of instructions. However, far less attention has been paid to the inverse task: instruction generation - learning a speaker to generate grounded descriptions for navigation routes. Existing VLN methods train a speaker independently and often treat it as a data augmentation tool to strengthen the follower, while ignoring rich cross-task relations. Here we describe an approach that learns the two tasks simultaneously and exploits their intrinsic correlations to boost the training of each: the follower judges whether the speaker-created instruction explains the original navigation route correctly, and vice versa. Without the need of aligned instruction-path pairs, such cycle-consistent learning scheme is complementary to task-specific training targets defined on labeled data, and can also be applied over unlabeled paths (sampled without paired instructions). Another agent, called creator is added to generate counterfactual environments. It greatly changes current scenes yet leaves novel items - which are vital for the execution of original instructions - unchanged. Thus more informative training scenes are synthesized and the three agents compose a powerful VLN learning system. Extensive experiments on a standard benchmark show that our approach improves the performance of various follower models and produces accurate navigation instructions.},

  abstract={The current cloud market features a multitude of cloud services that differ from one another in terms of functionality or of security/performance guarantees. Users wishing to use a cloud service for storing, processing, or sharing their data must be able to select the service that best matches their desiderata. In this paper, we propose a novel, user centric, brokering service for supporting users in the specification of requirements and enabling their evaluation against available cloud plans, assessing how much the different plans can satisfy the user's desiderata. Our brokering service allows users to specify their desiderata in an easy and intuitive way by using natural language expressions and high-level concepts. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy inference systems are adopted to quantitatively assess the compliance of cloud services with the users' desiderata, and hence to help users in the cloud service selection process.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={73-82},
  abstract={Owing to the inherent fault tolerance of deep neural network (DNN) models used for classification, many structural faults in the processing elements (PEs) of a systolic array-based AI accelerator are functionally benign. Brute-force fault simulation for determining fault criticality is computationally expensive due to many potential fault sites in the accelerator array and the dependence of criticality characterization of PEs on the functional input data. Supervised learning techniques can be used to accurately estimate fault criticality but it requires ground truth for model training. The ground-truth collection involves extensive and computationally expensive fault simulations. We present a framework for analyzing fault criticality with a negligible amount of ground-truth data. We incorporate the gate-level structural and functional information of the PEs in their "neural twins", referred to as "PE-Nets". The PE netlist is translated into a trainable PE-Net, where the standard-cell instances are substituted by their corresponding "Cell-Nets" and the wires translate to neural connections. Each Cell-Net is a pre-trained DNN that models the Boolean-logic behavior of the corresponding standard cell. In the PE-Net, every neural connection is associated with a bias that represents a perturbation in the signal propagated by that connection. We utilize a recently proposed misclassification-driven training algorithm to sensitize and identify biases that are critical to the functioning of the accelerator for a given application workload. The proposed framework achieves up to 100% accuracy in fault-criticality classification in 16-bit and 32-bit PEs by using the criticality knowledge of only 2% of the total faults in a PE.},

  abstract={Past research on software comprehension tools has produced a wealth of lessons in building good tools. However, our explanations of these tools tend to be weakly grounded in existing theories of cognition and human-computer interaction. As a result, the interesting rationales underlying their design are poorly articulated, leaving the lessons primarily implicit. This paper describes a way of using existing program comprehension theories to rationalize tool designs. To illustrate the technique, key design rationales underlying a prominent reverse engineering tool (the Reflexion Model Tool) are reconstructed. The reconstruction shows that theories of cognitive support can be applied to existing cognitive models of software developer behaviour. The method for constructing the rationales is described, and implications are drawn for codifying existing design knowledge, evaluating tools and improving design reasoning.},

  abstract={Fast, accurate, and effective performance analysis is essential for the design of modern processor architectures and improving application performance. Recent trends toward highly concurrent processors make this goal increasingly difficult. Conventional techniques, based on simulators and performance monitors, are ill-equipped to analyze how a plethora of concurrent events interact and how they affect performance. Prior research has shown the utility of critical path analysis in solving this problem. This analysis abstracts the execution of a program with a dependence graph. With simple manipulations on the graph, designers can gain insights into the bottlenecks of a design. This paper extends critical path analysis to understand the performance of a next-generation, high-ILP architecture. The TRIPS architecture introduces new features not present in conventional superscalar architectures. We show how dependence constraints introduced by these features, specifically the execution model and operand communication links, can be modeled with a dependence graph. We describe a new algorithm that tracks critical path information at a fine-grained level and yet can deliver an order of magnitude (30x) improvement in performance over previously proposed techniques. Finally, we provide a breakdown of the critical path for a select set of benchmarks and show an example where we use this information to improve the performance of a heavily-hand-optimized program by as much as 11%.},

  number={1},
  pages={19-26},
  abstract={Contribution: This paper describes a highly flexible design for a master's-level server administration course that uses updated technologies, addresses the most important course design challenges and extracts useful feedback from student work. The main contribution of this design is eliminating the self-regulation challenge students encounter in similar highly flexible computer-related courses. This is attributed to the introduction of orientation lectures and a competitive element; these may have helped students to achieve their goals on time. Background: The Web server administration course on the master's of the Web engineering program was intended to inculcate a series of competences, such as common administration techniques, procedures to increase security, efficient website deployment, and an introduction to clusters and infrastructure deployment automation. The course generally failed to transmit these competencies effectively; complaints were made about the difficulty of the course and the low applicability of its contents. Intended Outcomes: The design facilitates students finding assessment activities that better suit their profiles or previous experience, and enables them to customize their assessment, thus encouraging them and giving future value to their work. Application Design: The course design maximizes assessment flexibility by providing students with many optional activities from which to choose. It also promotes a healthy competitive spirit to improve student's motivation and results. Findings: Complaints about the difficulty or lack of applicability were no longer made. The course is highly valued by the students, achieving a very high pass rate and average score.},

  abstract={Enhanced AutoNav (ENav), the baseline surface navigation software for NASA's Perseverance rover, sorts a list of candidate paths for the rover to traverse, then uses the Approximate Clearance Evaluation (ACE) algorithm to evaluate whether the most highly ranked paths are safe. ACE is crucial for maintaining the safety of the rover, but is computationally expensive. If the most promising candidates in the list of paths are all found to be infeasible, ENav must continue to search the list and run time-consuming ACE evaluations until a feasible path is found. In this paper, we present two heuristics that, given a terrain heightmap around the rover, produce cost estimates that more effectively rank the candidate paths before ACE evaluation. The first heuristic uses Sobel operators and convolution to incorporate the cost of traversing high-gradient terrain. The second heuristic uses a machine learning (ML) model to predict areas that will be deemed untraversable by ACE. We used physics simulations to collect training data for the ML model and to run Monte Carlo trials to quantify navigation performance across a variety of terrains with various slopes and rock distributions. Compared to ENav's baseline performance, integrating the heuristics can lead to a significant reduction in ACE evaluations and average computation time per planning cycle, increase path efficiency, and maintain or improve the rate of successful traverses. This strategy of targeting specific bottlenecks with ML while maintaining the original ACE safety checks provides an example of how ML can be infused into planetary science missions and other safety-critical software.},

  abstract={Detecting novel objects without class information is not trivial, as it is difficult to generalize from a small training set. This is an interesting problem for underwater robotics, as modeling marine objects is inherently more difficult in sonar images, and training data might not be available apriori. Detection proposals algorithms can be used for this purpose but usually requires a large amount of output bounding boxes. In this paper we propose the use of a fully convolutional neural network that regresses an objectness value directly from a Forward-Looking sonar image. By ranking objectness, we can produce high recall (96 %) with only 100 proposals per image. In comparison, EdgeBoxes requires 5000 proposals to achieve a slightly better recall of 97 %, while Selective Search requires 2000 proposals to achieve 95 % recall. We also show that our method outperforms a template matching baseline by a considerable margin, and is able to generalize to completely new objects. We expect that this kind of technique can be used in the field to find lost objects under the sea.},

  abstract={Topological concepts and techniques have been broadly applied in computer graphics and geometric modeling. However, the homotopy type of a mapping between two surfaces has not been addressed before. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the problem of computing continuous maps with different homotopy types between two arbitrary triangle meshes with the same topology. Inspired by the rich theory of topology as well as the existing body of work on surface mapping, our newly-developed mapping techniques are both fundamental and unique, offering many attractive advantages. First, our method allows the user to change the homotopy type or global structure of the mapping with minimal intervention. Moreover, to locally affect shape correspondence, we articulate a new technique that robustly satisfies hard feature constraints, without the use of heuristics to ensure validity. In addition to acting as a useful tool for computer graphics applications, our method can be used as a rigorous and practical mechanism for the visualization of abstract topological concepts such as homotopy type of surface mappings, homology basis, fundamental domain, and universal covering space. At the core of our algorithm is a procedure for computing the canonical homology basis and using it as a common cut graph for any surface with the same topology. We demonstrate our results by applying our algorithm to shape morphing in this paper.},

  abstract={Changing system requirements, especially for context awareness (CA) systems, often cause modifications in the software systems in order to adapt to dynamic environments. Since the requirements may become temporarily obsolete or contrary to human intentions, the CA systems need to be tuned to resolve the conflict. On the other hand, most CA design methods rely on pre-defined requirements and reasoning engine, thus, fail to address all the possible situations. Consequently, services provided by such a CA system are limited to accommodate some situations and unable to react as expected. Therefore, it is critical for CA systems to capture exceptions at runtime, infer changed human intentions, and adapt to these changes. This study focuses on inference of ever-changing human intentions and monitoring human intentions to handle system evolution. In this paper, we present an inference mechanism of human intentions via the human-machine dimensional inference ontology (HDIO). This ontology gives inference rules based on the BDI logic to deduce human intentions from contexts. Furthermore, the inference exercises of a healthcare system example shows how user intentions relate to system requirements and how they help improve self-adaptability of CA systems.},

  abstract={Many applications have irregular behavior - e.g., input-dependent solvers, irregular memory accesses, or unbiased branches - that cannot be captured using today's automated performance modeling techniques. We describe new hierarchical critical path analyses for the Palm model generation tool. To obtain a good tradeoff between model accuracy, generality, and generation cost, we combine static and dynamic analysis. To create a model's outer structure, we capture tasks along representative MPI critical paths. We create a histogram of critical tasks with parameterized task arguments and instance counts. To model each task, we identify hot instruction-level paths and model each path based on data flow, data locality, and microarchitectural constraints. We describe application models that generate accurate predictions for strong scaling when varying CPU speed, cache and memory speed, microarchitecture, and (with supervision) input data class. Our models' errors are usually below 8%; and always below 13%.},

  abstract={The identification of suicidal thoughts in online social networks is an expanding field of study fraught with major challenges. Recent studies have shown that the readily available data, dispersed over many online life phases, contains useful clues for accurately identifying persons with suicidal intentions. The primary challenge in preventing suicide is learning to recognize and respond appropriately to the sometimes-confusing risk factors and warning indications that may precipitate an attempt. Indicators useful for diagnosing people with suicide thoughts can be found in publicly available material shared over social media platforms, according to recent studies. Understanding and recognizing the myriad risk factors and warning symptoms that may precede a suicide attempt is the primary difficulty in this area of public health. In this research, we developed a benchmark for multi-class categorization using machine learning models. We used a majority classifier, a frequency-based technique, and two deep learning models as our models. Both deep learning models outperformed the majority and the word frequency classifier, with results that were very comparable. These classification results are on par with the state-of-the-art on similar problems and, in most cases, with human results.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Detection of Suicidal Ideation in social media has gained special attention in recent years. Different mental health issues like depression, frustration, hopelessness etc directly or indirectly influence suicidal thoughts. Early detection of suicidal thoughts can help people to diagnose and get proper treatment in time. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are playing a vital role in this area to automatize Suicidal Ideation detection. In our study, we wanted to take this trend to the next level and proposed a new detection approach with the help of the Transformer models in the language domain. Basically with Transformers we wanted to analyze raw social media posts and classify the indication of suicidal ideation in them. First, we applied BiLSTM(Bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory) and from there took a jump to Transformer models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), ALBERT, ROBERTa and XLNET - a complete robust Transformer model based study. The main advantage of Transformer models is having pre-trained language models. Because of this, these models usually perform better. We found they work far better than conventional Deep Learning architecture like Bi-LSTM in our work.},

  abstract={Generative models are now capable of producing natural language text that is, in some cases, comparable in quality to the text produced by people. In the computing education context, these models are being used to generate code, code explanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption of these models has prompted multiple position papers and workshops which discuss the implications of these models for computing education, both positive and negative. This paper presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.},

  abstract={Computing Curriculum models have been historically framed from a cognitive perspective. Typically, the focus has been on bodies of knowledge and increasingly the notion of supporting skills and abilities. More recent curriculum documents such as the IT2017 curriculum have moved towards a professional competency approach and have included the further important notion of dispositions.While these dispositions are seen as complementing and supporting the traditional elements of knowledge and skills, exactly how they are conceptualised and operationalised is still being developed. The ACM/IEEE-CS Computing Curriculum 2020 Overview Project (CC2020) has been working towards this goal, in part driven by the very practical purpose of enabling visualisation of the multiple components of the existing and differing curriculum reports, incorporating the notion of dispositions and enabling them to be mapped to clusters of knowledge and skills embodied in selected curriculum statements.This paper reports on progress to date towards conceptualising and operationalising the notion of dispositions within the CC2020 project, reviews the research challenges faced, the models adopted and the findings to date.},

  pages={33-40},
  abstract={Design space exploration of microprocessor is still a challenging task for processor designers. Due to the huge design space, it is hard to determine the optimal configuration of microarchitecture parameters to satisfy the target performance and power requirements within limited time at the early stage of processor design. In this paper, a Critical Path Analysis directed Design Space Exploration (CPADSE) methodology for design space exploration of microprocessors is proposed. In CPADSE, a dependence graph model is constructed using the profile information generated during the program simulation. Then the critical paths of the dependence graph model are computed and patterns of the critical path are identified. The microarchitecture parameters mostly affecting processor`s performance or other metrics can be identified using the Plackett-Burman design method, which is always referenced as sensitivity analysis. Then the result of critical path analysis and sensitivity analysis is further used to guide the selection of search direction in both SA-CPADSE and TB-CPADSE design space search algorithms, which are proposed in this paper. Experiment result shows that for the design space exploration on SPEC 2000 benchmarks, SA-CPADSE obtains 2x speedup over baseline design space exploration algorithm SA-DSE. Additionally, TB-CPADSE on average obtains 4.3x speedup over SA-CPADSE and 7x speedup over SA-DSE. At the end of this paper, we have a detailed discussion about how to extend CPADSE methodology to design space exploration of multicore processors.},

  pages={783-788},
  abstract={Reliability analysis for a logic circuit is one of the primary tasks in fault-tolerant logic synthesis. Given a fault model, it quantifies the impact of faults on the full-chip fault rate. We present RALF, an exact algorithm for calculating the reliability of a logic circuit. RALF is based on the compilation of a circuit to deterministic decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF), a representation for Boolean formulas that can be more succinct than BDDs. Our algorithm can solve a large set of MCNC benchmark circuits within 5 minutes, enabling an optimality study of Monte Carlo simulation, a popular estimation method for reliability analysis, on real benchmark circuits. Our study shows that Monte Carlo simulation with a small set of random vectors generally has a high fidelity for the computation of full-chip fault rates and the criticality of single gates. While we focus on reliability analysis, RALF can also be used to efficiently locate random pattern resistant faults. This can be used to identify where methods other than random simulation should be used for accurate criticality calculations and where to enhance the testability of a circuit.},

  abstract={Near-peer mentoring has proven to be an effective strategy for supporting students from underrepresented groups in computing. In this paper, we present results from Rise Up and Sisters Rise Up to examine the experiences of mentors in near-peer mentoring programs. Rise Up and Sisters Rise Up are mentoring program initiatives that help secondary students from underrepresented groups succeed in their Advanced Placement Computer Science courses and exams. Drawing on the results from a mixed-method study, we focus on the experiences of mentors to address the following research question: How do near-peer mentoring experiences impact mentors' competency beliefs related to programming, mentoring, and culturally responsive teaching? Findings from the analysis of survey and interview data indicate that serving as a near-peer mentor reinforced mentors' prior programming knowledge, increased their programming self-efficacy beliefs, and prompted self-reflection on the purpose of mentoring relationships. In addition to these benefits, the results also revealed the need to provide mentors with continued opportunities to build mentoring competencies and practice culturally responsive teaching strategies. We conclude by discussing future work to improve our mentor training and further develop a mutually beneficial near-peer mentoring model for computing education that supports the development of mentors, as well as mentees.},

  abstract={Multihop knowledge reasoning aims to find missing entities for incomplete triples by finding paths on knowledge graphs. It is a fundamental and important task. In this article, we devise a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to model the reasoning process more effectively. Unlike existing methods directly reason on entities and relations, we adopt a high-level reasoning layer to deal with abstract concepts, which guides the reasoning process conducted at the low level for concrete entities and relations. Our approach yields competitive results on link prediction on both NELL-995 and FB15k-237 datasets. The comparison to baselines also demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure.},

  abstract={We present a new method to efficiently generate a set of morphologically diverse and inspiring virtual trees through hierarchical topology-preserving blending, aiming to facilitate designers' creativity production. By maintaining the topological consistency of the tree branches, sequences of similar yet different trees and novel intermediate trees with encouragingly interesting structures are generated by performing inner-species and cross-species blending, respectively. Hierarchical fuzzy correspondences are automatically established between two or multiple trees based on the multi-scale topology tree representations. Fundamental blending tasks including morph, grow and wilt are introduced and organized into a tree-structured blending scheduler, which not only introduces the randomness into the blending procedure but also wisely schedules the tasks to generate topology-aware blending sequences, contributing to a variety of resulting trees that exhibit diversities in both geometry and topology. Most significantly, multiple batches of blending can be executed in parallel, resulting in a rapid creation of a large repository of diverse trees.},

  title={Visual Analysis of Hyperproperties for Understanding Model Checking Results}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={28},
  number={1},
  pages={357-367},
  abstract={Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.},

  abstract={Background: Data breaches happen when an unauthorized party gains access to personally identifiable information. They are becoming more common and impactful, raising serious concerns for individuals as well as companies. Literature review: Although there is considerable literature on users’ mental models in security and privacy, there has been limited study of mental models related to data breaches. Research questions: 1. How do users understand data breaches? 2. What are their perceptions of the causes, responsibilities, and consequences, as well as possible prevention and appropriate follow up? Methodology: We explored end-user understanding of internet data breaches by conducting a study with 35 participants. They were asked to draw their understanding of data breaches and answer some open-ended and closed-ended questions afterwards. Results/discussion: Although their drawings varied in detail and complexity, we identified four patterns in the participants’ drawings: they illustrated abstractions of attacks to gain administrator access, end-user access, backdoor access, or access using database server vulnerabilities. We found that participants had a basic model of how an internet data breach happens, but with significant uncertainties regarding system vulnerabilities, causes, consequences, prevention methods, and follow-up steps after a breach. Conclusions: In all, end-user mental models of internet data breaches are basic and show gaps that emphasize the need for improved communication to increase users’ awareness and help them hold companies accountable.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={3250-3259},
  abstract={Automatically generating medical reports from retinal images is a difficult task in which an algorithm must generate semantically coherent descriptions for a given retinal image. Existing methods mainly rely on the input image to generate descriptions. However, many abstract medical concepts or descriptions cannot be generated based on image information only. In this work, we integrate additional information to help solve this task; we observe that early in the diagnosis process, ophthalmologists have usually written down a small set of keywords denoting important information. These keywords are then subsequently used to aid the later creation of medical reports for a patient. Since these keywords commonly exist and are useful for generating medical reports, we incorporate them into automatic report generation. Since we have two types of inputs expert-defined unordered keywords and images - effectively fusing features from these different modalities is challenging. To that end, we propose a new keyword-driven medical report generation method based on a non-local attention-based multi-modal feature fusion approach, TransFuser, which is capable of fusing features from different types of inputs based on such attention. Our experiments show the proposed method successfully captures the mutual information of keywords and image content. We further show our proposed keyword-driven generation model reinforced by the TransFuser is superior to baselines under the popular text evaluation metrics BLEU, CIDEr, and ROUGE.

  abstract={Cognitive load primarily depends on how an individual perceives, assimilates and responds to an external stimulus. We intend to create Electroencephalogram (EEG) models for the cognitive skills defined in the Bloom's taxonomy using low cost, commercial EEG devices. This could be applied in educational psychology to provide individual assistance according to one's learning style and abilities. The major challenge in using low resolution EEG device lies in signal analysis with reduced number of channels. In this paper, we present the signature of EEG signals for such low cost devices using three basic tasks namely, number matching; finding characters in text; finding hidden patterns and figures. These tasks map with understand, remember and analyze sub categories of Bloom's taxonomy. Different brain regions are activated while performing the above tasks. However, the EEG signals observed on the scalp are the manifestation of the combined effects of various brain regions. The cleaned EEG signals are analyzed using unsupervised clustering of features obtained from different frequency bands. A study is performed on 10 subjects using 14 lead Emotiv neuroheadset, so that one can get further insights on how an individual perceives certain cognitive tasks.},

  volume={29},
  number={1},
  pages={831-841},
  abstract={Traditional deep learning interpretability methods which are suitable for model users cannot explain network behaviors at the global level and are inflexible at providing fine-grained explanations. As a solution, concept-based explanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their flexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are groups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within the network's latent space and have commonly been hand-generated, but have recently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude and diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult to navigate and make sense of the concept space. Visual analytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling structured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide concept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design, develop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables people to interactively probe and explore the concept space to explain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was developed via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges that model users face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via a rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these challenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how the system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety of tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are important to classification, identifying bias in training data, and understanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly dissimilar classes.},

Their disengagement should be reduced by the involvement of something personally significant. Teachers should ensure that activities are designed and carried out in ways that offer each learner the chance to engage in the manner that suits them to the best. The paper describes selected computer science activities that should be used to engage the pupils or students in the learning process. We conclude that relatively simple teaching aid could help to explain even abstract computer science underlying concepts through the experience sometimes more effectively than through instructional model.},

  abstract={Selecting the desired ontology from a collection of available ones is essential for ontology reuse. We address the problem of evaluating, ranking and selecting ontologies according to user preferences. We exploit the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to solve the multiple-criteria decision problem and to model the preferences of the users. We use AHP to analyze the available ontologies from different perspectives and at different abstraction levels. The decision is based on the concrete end-node measurements and their relative importance at higher levels. For supporting the selection decision, we developed an ontology representation, reasoning and management system. The system applies different metrics on ontologies in order to feed the Analytic Hierarchy Process with facts. The running scenario applies our method to the task of reusing ontologies from the tourism domain.},

  abstract={Music has been a universal and essential component of ancient human civilizations throughout the world. Its origin is unclear and transcends our oldest records, but its importance remains preserved to date. The abstract and enchanting nature of music has attracted many brilliant minds throughout history and continues to do so even today. The idea of creating music without human intervention is not new, and time has witnessed many gifted individuals partaking in the fulfilment of this goal. The contemporary seeker has something the others lacked, technical advancements and knowledge. With the advent of AI, it was only natural that man used this tool to try and achieve this long-sought desire. With the growing advancements in deep learning and its success in tackling the most complex problems, it is proving itself as the closest solution to the realization of this goal. This paper explores the rich history and the implications of automatic music generation in the present-day world. It also conducts a comparison between the music generated by the implementation of two different deep learning techniques, the LSTM and GRU architectures.},

The material has proven difficult to teach to engineers, as it is empirical and based on processes founded on human interactions, not scientific and based on mathematical and physical laws. Simulation-based education has proven highly effective in getting past this barrier. Design of a number of pedagogical simulations, and experience with both professional and student audiences are discussed. Data is available to evaluate both a manufacturing simulation and a full simulation of an aerospace enterprise and its supply and engineering chains which capture enterprise interactions. Good data on student satisfaction and perceived outcomes, and lower-quality data on some directly-measured outcomes, support the idea that simulation-based education is highly effective in this challenging situation.},

  pages={1658-1675},
  abstract={This paper has proposed a novel authentication solution for the MapReduce (MR) model, a new distributed and parallel computing paradigm commonly deployed to process Big Data by major IT players, such as Facebook and Yahoo. It identifies a set of security, performance, and scalability requirements that are specified from a comprehensive study of a job execution process using MR and security threats and attacks in this environment. Based on the requirements, it critically analyzes the state-of-the-art authentication solutions, discovering that the authentication services currently proposed for the MR model is not adequate. This paper then presents a novel layered authentication solution for the MR model and describes the core components of this solution, which includes the virtual domain based authentication framework (VDAF). These novel ideas are significant, because, first, the approach embeds the characteristics of MR-in-cloud deployments into security solution designs, and this will allow the MR model be delivered as a software as a service in a public cloud environment along with our proposed authentication solution; second, VDAF supports the authentication of every interactions by any MR components involved in a job execution flow, so long as the interactions are for accessing resources of the job; third, this continuous authentication service is provided in such a manner that the costs incurred in providing the authentication service should be as low as possible.},

Also they were given instructions on building objects related to spatial reasoning activities (e.g., analysis and synthesis, deductive reasoning, development and application of visualization methods, systematic approach, and transformation) in Second Life. As a result, it was discovered that Second Life activities are more effective for the abstract conceptualization group than for the concrete experience group. This implies that activities provided in Second Life were more positively effective to abstract conceptualization learners on their information processing such as spatial reasoning.},

  abstract={Security is a critical aspect in the process of designing, developing, and testing software systems. Due to the increasing need for security-related skills within software systems, there is a growing demand for these skills to be taught in computer science. A series of security modules was developed not only to meet the demand but also to assess the impact of these modules on teaching critical cyber security topics in computer science courses. This full paper in the innovative practice category presents the outcomes of six security modules in a freshman-level course at two institutions. The study adopts a Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) as a project for students to demonstrate an understanding of the security concepts. Two experimental studies were conducted: 1) Teaching effectiveness of implementing cyber security modules and MEA project, 2) Students’ experiences in conceptual modeling tasks in problem-solving. In measuring the effectiveness of teaching security concepts with the MEA project, students’ performance, attitudes, and interests as well as the instructor’s effectiveness were assessed. For the conceptual modeling tasks in problem-solving, the results of student outcomes were analyzed. After implementing the security modules with the MEA project, students showed a great understanding of cyber security concepts and an increased interest in broader computer science concepts. The instructor’s beliefs about teaching, learning, and assessment shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered during their experience with the security modules and MEA project. Although 64.29% of students’ solutions do not seem suitable for real-world implementation, 76.9% of the developed solutions showed a sufficient degree of creativity.},

Having the ability of handling emotions is considered to make autonomic unit more intelligent, more communicative and more social. In this article we try to build an emotion model for agents that act as autonomic units in autonomic systems and can self-manage its behavior to achieve the best performance. From four levels we define four models progressively and the top-level model is defined on the foundation of the three below, combining them as a unity. By given arousing axioms theoretically of several typical emotions, the model is proved to be effective for reasoning emotions of autonomic unit, and can be easily extended for dealing with other type of emotions. On this base an architecture of emotional autonomic unit is described. An example shows that emotion plays an important role in intelligent decision making, which proves the validity of the model and the special function in practice.},

  abstract={Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generative methods, there is a notable absence of reliable evaluation metrics. Existing metrics usually focus on a single criterion each, such as how well the asset aligned with the input text. These metrics lack the flexibility to generalize to different evaluation criteria and might not align well with human preferences. Conducting user preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and human-aligned results. User studies, however, can be very ex-pensive to scale. This paper presents an automatic, ver-satile, and human-aligned evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models. To this end, we first develop a prompt generator using GPT-4V to generate evaluating prompts, which serve as input to compare text-to-3D models. We further design a method instructing GPT-4V to compare two 3D assets according to user-defined crite-ria. Finally, we use these pairwise comparison results to assign these models Elo ratings. Experimental results suggest our metric strongly aligns with human preference across different evaluation criteria. Our code is available at https://github.com/3DTopia/GPTEval3D.},

To categorize the player, we employ the principles of reinforcement learning in order to derive an iterative method of optimal responses that determine the policy of an agent with level-k intelligence in a general non-zerosum, nonlinear environment. For the special case of zero-sum, linear quadratic games we derive appropriate non-equilibrium game Riccati equations. To obviate the need for complete knowledge of the system dynamics, we employ a Q-learning algorithm as a best response solver. We then design an estimator that determines the distribution of intelligence levels in the adversarial environment of the system. Finally, simulation results showcase the efficacy of our approach.},

Instead of teaching the classic topic in an instructorcentered, direct instruction approach, the author constructed a WebQuest to help the students to design and conduct simulation projects to answer several nontrivial questions related to queueing theory. Scaffolding aids such as detailed descriptions of procedures and useful links to web resources, as well as an evaluation rubric, were also included in the WebQuest. This paper also includes results of a quantitative analysis on the effectiveness of adopting WebQuest to motivate students’ learning.

  abstract={Understanding a problem domain is a fundamental prerequisite for good software design. In object-oriented systems design, modeling is the fundamental first phase that focuses on identifying core concepts and their relations. How to properly support modeling is still an open problem, and existing approaches and tools can be very different in nature. On the one hand, lightweight ones, such as pen & paper/whiteboard or CRC cards, are informal and support well the creative aspects of modeling, but produce artifacts that are difficult to store, process and reuse as documentation. On the other hand, more constrained and semi-formal ones, like UML, produce storable and processable structured artifacts with defined semantics, but this comes at the expense of creativity. We believe there exists a middle ground to investigate that maximizes the good of both worlds, that is, by supporting software modeling closer to its essence, with minimal constraints on the developer's creativity and still producing reusable structured artifacts. We also claim that modeling can be best treated by using the emerging technology of touch-based tablets. We present a novel gesture-based modeling approach based on a minimal set of constructs, and CEL, an iPad application, for rapidly creating, manipulating, and storing language agnostic object-oriented software models, which can be exported as skeleton source code in any language of choice. We assess our approach through a controlled qualitative study.},

We call our optimization method agile optimization, because it allows users to preempt optimization and flexibly interleave alternative optimization methods and manual code modification, as needed. Agile optimization exploits the combined strengths of human insight and process automation to improve efficiency.

  abstract={Visual storytelling and story comprehension are uniquely human skills that play a central role in how we learn about and experience the world. Despite remarkable progress in recent years in synthesis of visual and textual content in isolation and learning effective joint visual-linguistic representations, existing systems still operate only at a superficial, factual level. With the goal of developing systems that are able to comprehend rich human-generated narratives, and co-create new stories, we introduce AESOP: a new dataset that captures the creative process associated with visual storytelling. Visual panels are composed of clip-art objects with specific attributes enabling a broad range of creative expression. Using AESOP, we propose foundational storytelling tasks that are generative variants of story cloze tests, to better measure the creative and causal reasoning ability required for visual storytelling. We further develop a generalized story completion framework that models stories as the co-evolution of visual and textual concepts. We benchmark the proposed approach with human baselines and evaluate using comprehensive qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our results highlight key insights related to the dataset, modelling and evaluation of visual storytelling for future research in this promising field of study.},

Analysis 1 used a factor analysis on a set of 19 self-reported cognitive skills exercised while respondents played various PC-based games. The results verified the hypothesis that a few general cognitive phases could be drawn from the 19 variables. The four meaningful and predictable factors were detection (D), understanding (U), decision-making (DM), and execution (E). These factors represent general cognitive stages found in human factors literature such as situational awareness theory. (2.) The second analysis correlated the four derived factors with the participants' self-report of specific game enjoyment features. The outcome of this project provided a set of blueprints or templates for proper selection of COTS SEs and their components when attempting to apply them for enhancing human performance or training utility.},

  abstract={The advanced developments in the use of the modern technology, such as three-dimensional (3D) printing, internet of things and wearable devices have experienced a significant acceleration in terms of theoretical and practical aspects. These advanced techniques have played an important and vital role in many different fields of our life including the field of architecture. However, the presentation curriculum in the field of architectural education is still lacking in the actual application and optimal use of the (3D) printing technology at the local level in architectural departments for Iraqi universities. The paper aims to identify the innovative technologies and utilize them in the field of architectural education through developing an integrated framework for the Architectural Presentation curriculum using (3D) printer techniques. The latest methods and innovative technologies that have been accepted and applied in the field of E-learning and its utilization in the field of architectural education were reviewed and evaluated. In this paper, therefore, we focused in the proposed framework on the use of the three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in Architectural Presentation and analysing the obstacles that may face the implementation of this technology locally. The results illustrate that there is an urgent need to adopt such an innovative technology (3D printer) in our architectural presentation curriculum, because of its effectiveness as a powerful tool in the academic education. It is anticipated that the three-dimensional printing technology will help not only to develop the architect capabilities in generating the (3D) objects and models, but also to enable architects to implement their project with an accurate, ease and quick manner.},

  abstract={Self-improving and self-integrating systems (SISSY) often employ runtime models to represent their state and environment, and reason upon them to determine the required adaptation logic for reaching their goals. However, most model-based approaches rely on static modeling languages and cannot handle runtime uncertainty (e.g. dynamically integrated resources) that requires online language extensions. In previous work, we proposed an approach to extend the system's modeling language with new monitoring and action dimensions. However, the solution generates a high number of new language elements, slowing down the reasoning process for large systems. In this position paper, we propose a multi-level approach for extending the modeling language at runtime, and aim to provide online learning and reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction. Increasing the modeling abstraction decreases the number of concepts to reason about, hence improving scalability. We provide a preliminary validation of this proposal by detecting novel abstract dimensions from monitoring data from the smart home domain.},

  pages={485-492},
  abstract={Improving undergraduates' information literacy level is the focus of contemporary higher education authorities. The information literacy level of undergraduates forms the core of the 21st-century talents and skills, and it is also an important factor influencing other skills. The cultivation of individual information literacy is influenced by both individual subjective factors and external objective factors. Based on the social constructivism theory, this study explores the influence of internal subjective factors (information processing dimension of learning style) and external objective factors (social media behaviour) on undergraduates' information literacy level through quantitative questionnaire data analysis. This study constructs a model of the internal and external influencing factors of undergraduates' information literacy level and proposes four hypotheses. The results verify the four hypotheses and prove the rationality of the model construction. In addition, suggestions are provided for individual undergraduates, high school management, and the concerned authorities of the social cultural environment.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Affective computing, particularly the identification of emotions from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signals, has gained importance. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network model called Cycle Consistent Multi-Task Variational Autoencoder (CycleMVAE) to simultaneously investigate pairwise translation of emotional features, signal reconstruction, and emotion classification across two different EEG recording samples. CycleMVAE comprises two Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and a supervised classifier. Each VAE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder of the first VAE transfers emotional properties from EEG sample X to a compact latent space Z, while the decoder retrieves these features from Z to transfer them to EEG sample Y. Similarly, the second VAE uses the compact latent space Z’ to transfer emotion features from EEG sample Y to EEG sample X. This forms a cyclic translation of feature among EEG sample recordings. The model is trained using reconstructed loss, cycle consistency loss, and latent vector regularization loss, with a supervised classifier used to categorize emotions into arousal, valence, and dominance categories. The proposed approach improves EEG classification performance while reducing pre-processing complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated by experimental findings on the multimodal DREAMER emotional database.},

  abstract={We developed an intelligent argumentation system for collaborative decision support which allows stakeholders to exchange arguments, captures their rationale, and assesses aggregate thoughts on solution alternatives [1, 21]. In this article we propose and evaluate a method for computing aggregate thoughts of arguments on individual arguments, which represents individual thoughts, in an argumentation tree and further classifying arguments based on relationships between its aggregate thoughts and individual thoughts. A novel approach is developed to derive collective determination of an argument based on total support and attack that an argument receives in the argumentation tree. The collective determination value and the strength of an argument are used to analyze the relationship between aggregate thought and individual thought of arguments and cluster the arguments. The decision maker will be able to review clusters of arguments with opposing collective thoughts and supporting collective thoughts versus their individual thoughts. We have carried out an experiment to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.},

The results demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuning a pre-trained image generation model on a limited dataset, as measured by the ROUGE score. Sarid's contributions include addressing the lack of Arabic story generation models, providing a comprehensive dataset of Arabic stories, and integrating text and image generation for a cohesive story generation pipeline.},

  abstract={We present ComposIt, a creativity support tool that assists designers in finding inspiration by providing many computer-generated examples. These examples may be beyond humans' imagination and thus are helpful to inspire users to create new ideas. To automatically produce examples, our system adopts the deconstruction and construction strategies that are commonly used in the creative industries. Given a 3D model, the model deconstruction module analyzes the model and divides it into several elements. Then the model construction module synthesizes examples by composing the elements from different models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted a user study, in which artists were invited to design using our system. The results conclude that our system is able to inspire artists in their design process. The artists also shared their usage experience of our system in various aspects.},

Analyzing, visualizing, and managing this massive amount of data causing remarkable issues and challenges which are not even resolve through traditional technologies. Therefore it requires innovative technologies or methods to resolve issues and challenges. The main aim of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of combination of big data with soft computing to overcome the issues and challenges more efficiently and in less time. Here emphasis is given on three main soft computing techniques namely neural network, fuzzy logic and genetic for minimizing big data related problems. Research questions are also formed for this purpose in the present paper from 2004-2015 as primary study that will help the researchers in future in their related study.},

  abstract={Previous researches have pointed out that simulation games can be an effective tool for enhancing the students' motivation to learn and understand complex subjects. Although the decision to use a simulation game is made mainly by the instructor, the students' perceptions are also important in order to support its usage. The increasing interest in educational simulation games motivates us to investigate relevant factors that influence the adoption of simulation games in Software Engineering courses. Based on a theoretical adoption model and on the evaluation of a specific simulation game, we identified crucial aspects beyond the ones usually considered, such as incorporating more industrial settings phenomena and pedagogical elements. These aspects are not always considered in Software Engineering simulation games, as we identified after an evaluation. Therefore, we concluded that this class of simulation games does not address suitably the adoption attributes that we found relevant.},

  abstract={As the business landscape progresses, the advancement of information systems is becoming increasingly valuable in shaping the future workforce. The rising demand for skilled employees who can navigate and manage technological tools and stay engaged in the workplace requires businesses to make significant efforts to advance their workforce's digital competencies and cognitive satisfaction. To understand this phenomenon better, considering the future workforce, specifically final-year students, could provide more valuable insights, as previous studies have been unable to capture this illustration fully. This research intends to understand willingness to engage behaviour of the future workforce through digital dexterity (i.e., personal-innovativeness, and computers self-efficacy) and psychological empowerment. A hypothesis-based framework delineated with seven paths, and data were collected through a questionnaire survey. To analyze the collected data from 147 respondents, a multivariate data analysis technique "PLS-SEM" was practiced. The study finding illustrated that personal innovativeness played a major role in impacting willingness to engage behavior followed by computer self-efficacy. These findings are novel and significant, providing new insights into the complex relationship between model variables among final-year students. The implications of this study would be particularly valuable for businesses looking to understand better and engage with the future workforce.},

Integrating hedonic elements into the human computer interface of GSS is one way to potentially enhance users' satisfaction with the meeting process, which in turn can influence usage intentions. Hence, this study explores the effects of perceived visual aesthetics on satisfaction with the meeting process using a free simulation study with twenty ad-hoc teams performing an idea generation and evaluation task. The results show a significant role of perceived visual aesthetics in predicting satisfaction with the meeting process.},

We consider facilitated CM as a process of undertaking CM primarily in facilitated workshops attended by a group of stakeholders. Facilitated workshops are a common practice in some fields of operational research (OR), System Dynamics (SD) and Problem Structuring Methods (PSM). The associated benefits of involving the stakeholders in the modelling process are reported in the literature such as enabling the mutual exploration of the problem situation and creating a strong ownership of the formulated problem. Further benefits related to CM are knowledge acquisition from domain experts, conflict resolution, fostering credibility and creativity. Reflecting on our experience, we consider the practical issues related to undertaking facilitated CM such as the group size and composition, team roles and the facilitator and the organization of workshops. The ideas put forward could be useful to modellers interested in undertaking facilitated CM.},

  abstract={Research skills are directly related to studying a problem thoroughly, investigating possible solutions, critically analyzing how to solve them, discussing, testing possibilities collaboratively, and adapting or creating new solutions. An undergraduate computing student with these competencies needs to understand and use different research methods, have a business vision, investigate technological alternatives, understand innovation models and their viability and, above all, know how to solve a problem systematically and collaboratively. Considering that these competencies are essentials in computing professionals, the following research question was defined: "How to stimulate research skills of undergraduate computing students?". Regarding answering that question, this Research Full Paper describes the design and implementation of an exchange program in the Research Laboratories of a public university in 2018 and 2019, aiming to foster research skills in undergraduate computing students. These experiences showed real benefits regarding students' performance in research, development, and innovation activities, besides improvement points for better management and execution. As the main contribution, it is possible to highlight the proposal for an exchange model between research laboratories, in which undergraduate students in Computing participate in research activities conducted in the PBL modality, learning through complex problems resolution under continuous monitoring and feedback.},

It is part of the Avebury, Stonehenge and Associated Sites World Heritage Site but is less well-known than Stonehenge, despite being an impressive monument with a ditch and bank system more than 400m in diameter. In the past 20 years or so many computer-based simulations of archaeological sites around the world have been created, but many of these digital reconstructions lack both the ability to enable personal presence of the user in the virtual landscape itself, and the facility for users to interact with others and the virtual environment around them in real time. The project described in this paper aims to research the issues of presence and interaction in virtually reconstructed ancient landscapes through a reconstruction of Avebury Henge in a virtual world environment, as it might have been circa 2,300 BCE. This paper describes and evaluates the construction phase of the project in a virtual world environment.},

  abstract={This Innovate Practice full paper, describes our experience in using the mini-case pedagogy to design and deliver a technical course, “Enterprise Integration” which is a year two course in the Information Systems undergraduate program. Case method is one approach that has been widely adopted in teaching many professions including law, medicine and business. The general practice is to ask students to read the case, usually four to eight pages long, prior to the session, and then spend the whole session discussing the case. However, for technology courses, the students are required to learn concepts and apply them using hands-on software tools through lab sessions. Hence, rather than use long cases, that cover the entire session, we need to use mini-cases that are usually one to two pages long. This pedagogy approach allows the class session to be designed with tight integration across the concept presentation lecture, mini-case analysis and hands-on lab session. We share the pedagogy implementation details and challenges, and discuss our findings and lessons learnt in designing and implementing the mini-case pedagogy. Thus providing one pathway for Information Systems and Computer Science professors to, implement the mini-case pedagogy in “technology heavy” courses.},

  abstract={As scientific communities become increasingly complex and interdisciplinary, implementing policies that foster collective creativity for science-based innovation emerges as a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of socio-communication strategies on innovation capacity based on experiments using a general-purpose model that aims to study dynamic processes of collective creativity in scientific communities. Experimental results indicate that low communication frequency, openness and receptivity lead to higher variety. On the contrary, variety decreases with increasing receptivity under high communication frequency. If more communication channels exist, the connectivity-driven preferential attachment strategy is beneficial in fostering innovation in terms of generated networks with low density and high centrality. Additionally, balance theory suggests higher levels of knowledge diffusion efficiency.},

  abstract={Today's physical and human made systems have become more and more complex and dynamic. The concept of complex dynamic systems (CDS) arises in many scientific fields, technological areas and everyday's problems. Modelling and controlling complex dynamic systems is a very difficult and challenging task. Theories of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps have been proposed and mathematically formulated as a new way to model and control complex dynamic systems. FCM theories have been used successfully in many applications, they still present several limitations. These limitations as well as the increasing complexity of the systems dictate the need to reapproach Fuzzy Cognitive Maps to make them more efficient. Well-known drawbacks and limitations of FCM are described and certain solutions to overcome them are given in an integrated and unified way. The state space approach is used to address these drawbacks and the concepts of the FCM are categorized into fuzzy state concepts, input concepts and output concept. A number of solutions to the drawbacks are provided. A novel innovative approach been called, Advanced FCM theories is presented. Conclusions are given and future research directions are provided.},

The few studies of IS designer behaviors that are reported in IS have focused on small tasks in single sessions, and have ignored the impact of modeling techniques on the design process. In this paper, we report preliminary results based on a study of two designers engaged in a multi-session design task using the object-oriented design modeling techniques. We use an extended version of the model proposed by Adelson and Soloway to analyze the verbal protocols. Our observations and interpretations focus on the existence of problem and design spaces and designers' use of these during design. Specifically, we discuss the distinction between problem and design spaces during object-oriented design, the shifts in emphasis between problem and design spaces, and changes in designer behaviors between the two spaces.},

A taxonomy for setting tangibility in multimedia realm is required for grounding guideline stipulating the consistent way of using tangible artefacts within multimedia context. This paper begins discussion by looking into facets of tangibility dimension by way of literature review. The taxonomy suggests multimedia tangibility can be achieved at least on six facets, namely abdication, loose, naturalness, link semantics, cardinality, and comprehensive mapping facets. Discussion followed by elaboration of each of their associated functions. The paper is concluded with a brief description of a research results, which revealed the efficacy of tangible multimedia compliant with some of the facets of the taxonomy in elevating learners learning performance.},

  abstract={Suicide is one of the major causes of death globally. Analysis of social media posts and in-depth insights show that some people have suicide ideas. In order to save more lives, it is crucial to comprehend the behavior of suicidal attempters. However, identifying and explaining suicidal thoughts poses a significant challenge in psychiatry. Additionally, analysing suicidal behavior is a complex procedure involving several variables based on the individual’s preferences and the data type. Although traditional methods have been utilized to identify clinical factors for suicide ideation detection (SID), these models often lack interpretability and understanding. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to apply several deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as BERT, LSTM, BiLSTM, RF, SVM, GaussianNB, LR, and KNeighbors blending with interpretable models such as LIME and SHAP to provide valuable insights into the importance of different features and make models more transparent in the SID process. The experiments were conducted on a publicly available dataset comprising 24,101 posts, categorized as either suicidal or non-suicidal. The implemented method brings about significant enhancements in performance in comparison. A comparison of all performance measures reveals that the LSTM model is particularly good at processing and classifying textual data, with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores than the other models tested.},

  abstract={Critical path analysis is a traditional way to study the parallelism of conservative parallel simulation. In this paper, we propose a new technique called state causality analysis to accurately model the conservative parallel network simulation. A theorem of simulation time advancement is presented and proved. Different from critical path analysis, our method focuses on the dependency of the logical process states instead of the unpredictable events. The effects of many algorithm-independent factors, such as lookahead, I/O overhead, physical transfer delay, processor speed and event distribution, are all taken into consideration. With this method, the complicated relations between parallel performance and the algorithm-independent factors can be revealed distinctly, which however cannot be revealed by critical path analysis in most cases. The theoretical analyses and experiments show that our method always predict a stricter upper bound on the performance of a given network simulation task than critical path analysis, which may provide a baseline to evaluate the conservative synchronization algorithms excluding the effects of algorithm-independent factors.},

  abstract={The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is growing rapidly. The deep neural network is a field of ML which is showing greater possibility. The deep neural network has been widely acknowledged as being in a golden age and advancing with the advent of new technologies. It is slowly becoming the leader of the technological world in artificial intelligence. The models which are built by machine learning algorithms with great accuracy help in every sector of human evolution. Image and audio processing is done through many algorithms to intensify its behavioral pattern. The development of modern art is largely dependent on the painters who are developing the style. The Deep Dream algorithm can also do the artistic creation of the image and audio. The deep dream algorithm which googles engineer Alexander Mordvintsevin built in the year 2015. It enhances the patterns in the multimedia through algorithmic pareidolia. It creates a dream-like effect. It gives a new vision of hallucinations to images. This could be used in the health sector for the purpose of detecting diseases and defects through scans of the patients. It is redefining lower-definition multimedia to higher-definition multimedia. Previous model were able to only generate one of the multimedia format. Proposed system will be able to create multimedia based on DeepDream and link different formats together so that they appear to be generated together.},
