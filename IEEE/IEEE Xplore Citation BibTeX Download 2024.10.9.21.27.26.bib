  abstract={This article illustrates a simulation method to find a sizing and economic of a required photovoltaic array for a photovoltaic building in Malaysia. This paper represents the result using by Matlab software. It is known that the important factor for photovoltaic system is cost of a system, and because of several kinds of the photovoltaic array we have the right to elect the best array with the best efficiency. The popular types of materials are crystalline and thin films, which have differences in terms of light absorption efficiency, energy conversion efficiency, manufacturing technology and cost of production. Different kinds of crystalline materials like a mono-crystalline, polycrystalline are available. In this paper, the generated current and generated power by the photovoltaic array is calculated according to daily solar irradiation when the case study is Malaysia. Think over generated power of each array's and also according to required energy for a typically building, the number of photovoltaic array is estimated then the cost of the solar array is calculated. System is simulated by Matlab software, and the results are discussed. The simulation is about sizing in order to select the best array for photovoltaic system to have a optimize system according to size of the system.},

  abstract={The reason for this review is to introduce a basic diagram of steering convention for low power and lossy system. Additionally talk about the points of interest and impediments of a convention and think about them. Wireless sensor networks are appealing to specialists because of their extensive variety of use potential in ranges, for example, target identification and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and strategic frameworks. On the other hand, lower sensing ranges result in dense networks, which bring the need to accomplish a proficient medium access protocol subject to power imperatives. The IPv6 directing convention for low-power and lossy systems (RPL) has been as of late standardized by the Engineering Task Force (IETF) steering convention for low-control and Lossy networks (ROLL) working social event to bolster IPv6 directing for asset compelled contraptions in the present day, home, additionally, metropolitan situations. Regardless, a couple studies have created the impression that RPL may experience low delivery rates, especially in extensive scale organizations. This paper gives an in-depth examination of the protocol attributes and outline decisions that create such lack of quality issues. In proposed work, we perform data compression and trust calculation which will reduce data sending time and also improves lossless data transmission.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={365-369},
  abstract={The traditional way of thinking in controller design prefers the use of the “state space representation” introduced by R. Kalman in the early sixties of the past century. This system description is in close relationship with linear or at least partly linear system in which the linear part can be used in forming a quadratic Lyapunov function in the stability proof. In the standard model of such systems it is assumed that the state of the system is not directly observable, only certain linear functions of the state variable are directly measurable. Since such approaches introduce certain feedback gains for the state variable, observers are needed that calculate the estimation of the state variable on the basis of directly measurable quantities. The Luenberger observers solve this task via introducing a differential equation for the estimated state. In order to avoid the mathematical difficulties of Lyapunov's “direct method” the “Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)” were introduced in a novel adaptive technique that instead of the state space representation directly utilized the available approximate model of the system to estimate its “response function”. In this approach it was assumed that the system's response is directly observable and an iterative sequence was generated by the use of “Banach's Fixed Point Theorem” that converged to an appropriate deformation of the rough initial model to obtain precise trajectory tracking. In the present paper it is shown that the Luenberger observers and the RFPT-based mathod can be combined in a more conventional approach of the adaptive controllers that are designed on the basis of finding appropriate feedback gains. Illustrative simulation examples are presented to substantiate this statement.},

  abstract={The proposed project is to design a system to track and locate mobile Alzheimer's disease patients who suffer from lapses of memory and concentration. Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior and is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually make over a number of years. In these circumstances, tracking and locating a patient becomes very essential. In this paper the patient carries a tracking module that when queried from the caregiver, automatically locates itself by a GPS receiver, and then relays this information to the caregiver via GSM. The system is highly useful in tracking the patient's and informing the caregivers regarding their position.},

  abstract={The Plant Hospitals Maintenance Department maintains the physical environment and provides related services to support medical centers is in reaching their goal of excellence in the delivery of healthcare and public service. Thus, health-care facilities exist to save lives, improve patient health, and reduce pain. Administrators rightly do not consider themselves to be power reliability experts. Yet without emergency power to ensure continuous power to medical equipment, the health-care facility's life-saving mission can be jeopardized, costs can soar, and the profitability of the facility, on which its continued existence depends, can be threatened. With hospitals becoming more electronic, more must be protected by emergency power. Hospital systems increasingly overlap electronically. Well-designed emergency power systems adapt to the changing environment. Emergency power is thus critical and is expensive but if medical center does not have electricity, that's even more expensive. We should think of everything electronic a hospital runs on: security, radiology, cat scans, and operating rooms. And, that's just the big stuff. This paper act as a direct resource for some management plans supporting the environment of Care which should provide a safe, functional, supportive, and effective environment for patients, staff members, and individuals who come to Saudi medical centers facilities. The aims of the survey (this paper) are to: Understand managerial work of the stand by emergency power plant. Determine their most essential functions, roles, skills, challenges and on-job training issues. Identify differences in perceptions and professional practice, based on their qualification and managerial experience. Address maintenance methods of the hospitals emergency power systems, emergencies and electric safety for all members of the hospital community.},

We proposed a skolemize clauses binding (SCB) for reasoning, along with the theorem proving to provide the basis answer extraction. QA systems employing combination of SCB and resolution theorem proving have been used to provide both satisfying and hypothetical answers. Satisfying answers are associated with ground term corresponding with questions whose logical form contains variables. Hypothetical answer is an answer which comes from the story or plot of text, and required logical thinking because it is not explicitly stated in the knowledge domain. In this case, the answer can be considered as a set of logical formula called skolemize clauses defining sufficient conditions characteristic the tuples of individuals which satisfying the query.},

Thus, in order to get realistic insight about the supplier behavior, it is necessary to model the supplier's risk strategy and evaluate its effect on the bidding problem. Considering the human's thinking fuzzy nature, the supplier agent's risk characteristic is modeled using the fuzzy logic. Combining the fuzzy logic with the Q-learning algorithm, the intelligent supplier agent' bidding strategy is determined based on his risk strategy.

  year={2015},

  pages={421-424},
  abstract={The Compressed Sensing (CS) framework outperforms the sampling rate limits given by Shannon's theory. This gap is possible since it is assumed that the signal of interest admits a linear decomposition of few vectors in a given sparsifying Basis (Fourier, Wavelet, ...). Unfortunately in realistic operating systems, uncertain knowledge of the CS model is inevitable and must be evaluated. Typically, this uncertainty drastically degrades the estimation performance of sparse-based estimators in the low noise variance regime. In this work, the Off-Grid (OG) and Basis Mismatch (BM) problems are compared in a Bayesian estimation perspective. At first glance, we are tempted to think that these two acronyms stand for the same problem. However, by comparing their Bayesian Cramèr-Rao Bounds (BCRB) for the estimation of a L-sparse amplitude vector based on N measurements, it is shown that the BM problem has a lower BCRB than the OG one in a general context. To go further into the analysis we provide for i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes and in the low noise variance regime an interesting closed-form expression of a normalized 2-norm criterion of the difference of the two BCRB matrices. Based on the analysis of this closed-form expression, we obtain two conclusions. Firstly, the two uncertainty problems cannot be confused for a non-zero mismatch error variance and with finite N and L. Secondly, the two problems turn to be similar for any mismatch error variance in the large system regime, i.e., for N, L → ∞ with constant aspect ratio N/L → ρ.},

  abstract={China began to research the tertiary oil recovery process from the 1980s. This technology is very mature in the current, but the economic benefits for the EOR project evaluation studies are relatively less and simple, moreover, the evaluation method is single, almost all enterprises have chosen to use net present value method. But net present value method ignores the flexibility which is managed by the decision-makers under uncertainty, not suitable for oil field development investment project evaluation. Real option valuation and strategic decision-making are an important way of thinking, often used in the evaluation of oil exploration, but for oil and gas production, dynamic process of evaluation studies are rarely involved. As the EOR project has the option characteristics, this article will introduce the idea of real options to the EOR project and try to establish the differential equation model of the EOR project evaluation. Differential equations are used for tertiary oil recovery project to analyze the option value.},

  abstract={With the present home security system, a timer is incorporated in a terminal installed in the home. The purpose is to allow the user time to change the alarm mode of the terminal from disarmed to armed and close the door when leaving the residence; conversely, the user needs time to open the door and change the alarm mode from armed to disarmed when returning to the residence. However, we think the timer is stressful for the user and represents a problem that, should an intruder gain entry, the situation cannot be reported immediately. Therefore, we propose a system to solve these problems. Since the proposed system is capable of recognizing the principal user through the use of an RFID tag, the terminal can appropriately change the alarm modes and quickly provide notification of an intruder. We will also confirm that the proposed system functions effectively through experiments, describe the effectiveness of the proposed system, and consider feasibility studies.},

Comparing with TGA, the genetic operation of PGA is simpler; the initial population of PGA need not be varied; there is no "immature convergence" during using PGA; the searching efficiency of PGA is higher. As PGA uses the reproduction manner with only parent while no using the reproduction manner with double parents as such most of the biology, most of the scholar thinks that PGA does not belong to the category of genetic algorithms. In this paper, based on concept of abstract system, two abstract systems, PGA and TGA are constructed and it is proved that the two abstract systems are isomorphic, so PGA has the same computing mechanism as TGA, that is to say, PGA belongs to the category of genetic algorithms as TGA.},

  abstract={The power system measurement data has high-dimensional features and strong noise, which is difficult to be directly used for intrusion detection. Traditional feature extraction and selection methods take the feature processing as a preprocessing step and perform separately from the model training, which makes the features not well adapted to the model. Therefore, we propose a novel wrapped feature selection framework based on the Las Vegas algorithm, which can improve the detection accuracy by strengthening the coupling between the feature selection and the model training. The Las Vegas algorithm can evaluate a feature subset through a specified model. In this paper, a heuristic thinking is integrated into the Las Vegas algorithm, which greatly improves the search performance of the original method. Finally, the proposed framework is examined on the IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus and 57-bus test systems for two attacks and the experimental results proves the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.},

Cyberbullying has greatly affected people's daily lives. We conduct this study to detect whether online comments contain cyberbullying behaviours and classify cyberbullying to alleviate this problem. This paper uses an improved information gain algorithm for feature selection, and the bidirectional LSTM neural network is used for classification. On the premise that the information gain threshold is limited to 0.0004, the precision on the test set can reach 95.15%.},

  abstract={Sleep plays a parallel role in maintaining good health as diet and exercise. It not only improves the performance of our brain but also manages our mood swings and maintains our health. Not getting proper hours of sleep on a regular basis may become the reason for many disorders and diseases. Stress often impacts the sleep cycle of an individual resulting in a severe impact on their physical and mental health. Stress even affects the cognitive functioning of an individual, which refers to the mental processes involving memory management, decision thinking, etc. So, eventually, stress becomes a common factor for both. This study proposes an approach helping individuals to reduce stress by turning towards a proper sleep cycle eventually resulting in an increase in cognitive functioning. This paper uses the conventional method of machine learning through which it could be justified that as stress increases the number of hours slept by the person decreases. Furthermore, a correlation was established between sleep stress and cognitive functioning through which it could be concluded that sleep affects cognitive functioning. Previous research studies suggest that there is a link between video games and increased cognitive functioning, So, this study proposed the solution as a game named CANDY CRUSH which is much popular among middle age groups as it is easy to learn and can prove to be stress releaser for them eventually leading to better cognitive functioning.},

  abstract={Interaction is a process in which two or more people exchange thoughts and feelings with each other, transmit information and influence both sides. Class interaction refers to the interaction between teachers, students and students in the special environment of classroom. IoT is a network that connects any goods with the Internet through various information sensing devices according to the agreed protocol, and carries out information exchange and communication, so as to realize intelligent identification, positioning, tracking, monitoring and management. Applying the conceptual model and thinking mode of the Internet of Things (IoT) to English Language Teaching (ELT) can also get good results, which leads to the change of ELT mode. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the current IoT technology application process, and expounds the application of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm in university ELT process. The simulation results show that the accuracy of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm is higher than that of traditional algorithm. With the increase of the number of experiments, the accuracy of RETE algorithm is stable at about 95%, and the real-time wavelength tends to be stable. Therefore, applying the IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm to English interactive teaching can make IoT technology play a more active role in ELT in universities and achieve better implementation effect.},

  year={1999},

  number={},
  pages={259-266},
  abstract={Since the seminal works of R.F. Engle (1982) and T. Bollerslev (1986) about heteroskedastic return series models, many extensions of their (G)ARCH models have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the functional dependence of conditional variances and the shape of the conditional distribution of returns have been varied in several ways (A.K. Bera and M.L. Higgins, 1993; T. Bollerslev et al., 1992). These two issues have been addressed by the neural network community using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and mixture density networks (MDNs). We extend the concept of MDNs in a recurrent way to allow for "GARCH effects". These recurrent MDNs (RMDNs) offer a consistent framework to analyze the impact of nonlinearity and of non Gaussian (leptokurtic) conditional distributions on the explanatory power of volatility models. We present numerical experiments on a very large return data set, the size of which allows one to perform detailed statistical tests to compare the obtained results. In summary, conditional non Gaussian distributions (fat tails in the conditional distributions) tend to be more important than nonlinear specifications for conditional means and variances in the likelihood framework. With respect to other error measures however, the application of nonlinear neural networks seems to be promising. We think that the choice of a particular model for predicting volatility is closely related to the question of how to measure the prediction performance of a model.},

  abstract={Slow learner is a person who has low level intelligence of thinking skills compared to other people at average age rate. In Malaysia, slow learners have been recognized as students who need special education. The Ministry of Education has created classes for special needs in several schools in order to help them in learning. In class, slow learner students have difficulty in memorizing and understanding a topic especially in mathematics. Using a new technology as educational tools will help them in better understanding of a concept. Implementing educational game applications in learning will help them more focus and enjoy. However, educational games that focus on mathematics for slow learners are rarely found. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop an educational game for primary school slow learners that focus on mathematics. This project implements the ADDIE model for the development of the project. There are five phases including this model which are Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The testing and evaluation had been conducted at school at Temerloh, Pahang involved slow learner’s students and a teacher. The result indicated that the students and teacher give positive feedback and they agree that this application helps the slow learner to get better understanding in mathematics subjects.},

  abstract={As the community is now a days moving rapidly towards the cloud, its security is something we really need to think and research about. The problem of security is as old as the internet is, and hence a number of solutions for the problem has also been thought of. Many of the various solutions consists using firewalls for the network or in the host, anti-malware programs installed on the system, packet-sniffing techniques for detection of malicious entities as well as fake traffic, pattern and signature matching techniques for various files that the system has to deal with every now and then. One of these is solutions is deploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the network. Here, we have devised a model that will be able to find any unwanted intrusions in the network. For this, we have employed Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm which we will see is an effective algorithm to use. In the first step, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is built using GA with natural selection method. The proposed hybrid algorithm in this scheme is then tested for the detection of malicious network traffic date set.},

  abstract={Today's era is of the digital images, what we think, imagined is created in the form of digital images. The forgery detection is technique which can detect the cloning from the images. The availability of different images, editing tools have made it easier for a common user to mislead the images and create digital fake images from it. The forgery detection has various techniques like active and passive techniques, moreover the properties like analysis, classification etc, are used to identify the forgery. The work presented in this paper is based on cloning forgery detection. The cloning forgery technique is one of the type of forgery detection techniques in which some area of the image is copied and moved to some another area of the same image which is not easy for the naked eyes to detect easily. The PCA (Principle Component Analysis) technique is used to find the mismatched pixels from the image. In the presented work, the GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) technique is applied with the PCA for the forgery detection. The proposed work is implemented in MATLAB and results are analyzed in terms of PSNR, Recall, Precision and accuracy. In the presented work, the results are better due to less fault rate or able to recover two different attacks (Gaussian noise and motion blur). It is analyzed that the proposed algorithm performs well as compared to the existing algorithm. In existing method the results of their parameters like accuracy were less accurate then proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method achieves more accuracy precession and recall.},

The paper describes a research experiment in which an environment consisting of three tasks on a computer screen is used to analyze quantitatively the mutual effect of these tasks. The first is a tracking task, which is a typical skill-based one. The second is to recognize the visual information that is indicated by four different media on a computer screen and to respond as soon as possible. The third is to listen to a conversation and answer a question about it. In this paper we have examined the effect of third task on the first and the second tasks. There was no effect on the performance of the tracking task. The time needed to respond after getting the information was affected a little by the third task. The number of instances of overlooking the visual information in the second task was significantly increased by the effect of the third task. This point might be one of the causes that result in a car accident.},

  abstract={Web sites are most effective when they meet both the contents and usability needs of their users. Due to tremendous growth of web application, it increases the complexity of web applications and web navigation. Website design is easy task but, to navigate user efficiently is big challenge, one of the reason is user behavior is keep changing and web developer or designer not think according to user's behavior. Designing well-structured websites to facilitate effective user navigation patterns has long been a challenge in web usage mining with various applications like navigation prediction and improvement of website management. Different methods have been proposed to reorganize Web Pages to improve users navigation using users navigation data but it still causes disorienting users and increases user's cognitive load. There is a need to improve the efficiency and the performance of a website for effective user navigation. Through this Paper we will propose Mathematical programming model to improve user navigation while minimizing alteration to current structure. Optimal solution can be very quickly obtained. We are minimizing unnecessary changes to the present structure of a Web site and hence can be applied for Web site maintenance on a regular basis.},

  abstract={This paper aims to consider the changes in the international investment environment and bring high uncertainty to multinational enterprises. Therefore, multinational enterprises invest in overseas markets according to the degree of capital expenditure, and adopt progressive investment. The order of capital expenditure (low to high) is divided into four stages, the first stage of export or authorization, and the second stage of opening the franchise chain, the third stage of joint venture, the fourth stage of acquisition or the establishment of foreign branch. Under the uncertainty of investment cash flow and exchange rate changes, use the option to growth or option to abandon of binomial options evaluation method to predict the four-stage cash flow and exchange rate changes. In view of the four stages of multinational enterprises' orderly capital costs (low to high), each stage selects the best decision, uses the option to growth to invest capital or option to abandon to give up the investment. This paper constructs a dynamic and successive investment binomial options decision model, estimates the equity value of overseas investment of multinational enterprises, and conducts investment strategy feasibility assessment. And compare the traditional investment decision NPV method, providing managers with a more flexible decision-making thinking mode for multinational enterprise investment.},

Application of an integrated product model has a chance of establishment of highly efficient processes for product definition. Product modeling has reached a level where sophisticated representations of object data and relationships are available at every day engineering activities. This information based model is defined by the authors as classical product model. The problem is at the application of this model because information in it is a result of a complex human thinking process content of which is not communicated with the model from the decision maker to the engineer who applies or revises the model. In this paper, the authors introduce their approach and method for a product model that is suitable for better communication between human and processes at generation of classical product model. After a short introduction of related research works, the authors analyzed the changed role of knowledge in product definition. Following this, knowledge and human intent are discussed in order to establish human intent based knowledge representations in product model. In the rest of the paper, the authors introduce the concept of content of product information and propose a multilevel structure for integrated information and information content based product modeling.

The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how PAL-D System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is superior then the NTSC system used in American Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.},

Keeping this view in thought, we analyze around 12000 tweets of Indian people to find out whether there is a trend shift of thinking pattern and mindset of Indian people as the pandemic progresses. The study is bifurcated into stages to clearly see the paradigm shift. We use tweets since twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to its optimum to have a good amount of understanding of the sentiments of the people. Analyzing the twitter dataset, we derive results and find out whether the amount of negative tweets v/s positive (or motivational) tweets have increased or not as the pandemic progresses. The study is supported by graphical visualizations of the polarity of the tweets month wise. Further, Wordmap approach is used to perform qualitative mining analysis in addition to the sentiment score based calculation. This work helps us to understand how the public opinions are changing with the changes in the spread dynamics of the virus. This kind of mood mining helps in identifying the Covid-19 situation from the psychological perspective that whether there is a sense of fear among people or they are quite optimistic of the situation. It can help in a great extend to the strategic and decision making bodies to plan out for future decisions. Further, such kind of studies can be used as reference to provide insights about mental health of people for any future incident or event of such nature.},

  abstract={There are still many mysteries as to why humans can talk. Especially in birds there is something that can reproduce human's pronunciation. For monkeys as well, it is possible to perform human pronunciation functionally in terms of airway configuration. However, these animals do not have language features. In recent years, research and development of AI which gained a deep impression on deep learning and big data is prevalent. After learning sound, AI can recognize and utter a conversation. Monkeys can see things by eye, recognize them, and eat for food if it is food. AI can cause the robot to take similar actions. Given the mechanism of speech recognition, it is identified as a word unit, a phrase or a sentence by identification of sound, coding of maximum likelihood, and probabilistic syllable estimation using existing databases such as triphones. It can be thought that birds or monkeys can do this sound again through the articulation mechanism. However, it is impossible to freely extract words and phrases from learned sentences, create sentences with new meanings, and pronounce them. Here, I think that the boundary of presence or absence of language is the presence or absence of this function. I'm studying to predict the factors that language has in human beings from the dental field. In the dental field, various information such as the shape of teeth and jaws are accumulated historically and over time. Recent studies have shown that vowels can be pronounced like humans, not humans. However, it is my expectation that consonants, especially fricatives, that adjust the advanced sound with the tongue will probably be difficult. Even children, it is difficult to pronounce fricatives until about 6 years old. I have been conducting research using aerodynamic acoustic techniques to understand why it is difficult to acquire fricative sounds, so I will tell you about things that have been understood so far.},

  abstract={The deep development of AI urgently needs a unified logic that could describe the whole course of thinking laws as its basic theory. The research goal of flexible logics is to explore the general law of logic. Measure error of flexible propositional truth value affects all the flexible logical operations by affecting the truth value calculation of flexible NOT propositions. In this paper, the general principles of N-Norm in triangle norm theory are introduced. The effect of the generalized self-correlativity to logic NOT operator model in [0,∞) is clarified theoretically by N-norm. Hence we acquire an important element for generating flexible logical operation models - N-generator integrity cluster, which is helpful to find the general rules of the definition of flexible NOT propositional connective in [0,∞) interval. These researches provide the important theoretical base for 1-level operation model in [0,∞) interval in flexible logics.},

  abstract={We discuss some aspects of a well known algorithm for inhomogeneity intensity correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the parametric bias correction (PABIC) algorithm. In this approach, the intensity inhomogeneity is modelled by a linear combination of 2D or 3D Legengre polynomials (computed as outer products of 1D polynomials). The model parameter estimation process proposed in the original paper is similar to a (1+1) Evolution Strategy, with some small and subtle differences. In this paper we discuss some features of the algorithm elements, trying to uncover sources of undesired behaviors and the limits to its applicability. We study the energy function proposed in the original paper and its relation to the image formation model. We also discuss the original minimization algorithm behavior. We think that this detailed discussion is needed because of the high impact that the original paper had in the literature, leading to an implementation into the well known ITK library, which means that it has become a de facto standard.},

  abstract={T Fake drugs threatens medical supply chain frightfully over 124 countries in the world. Even in Japan, although nobody expected counterfeits violate the maintained distribution of this country, fake harvoni for hepatitis C sold at an authorized pharmacy shocked officials in Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Anti-counterfeit to prevent fake drugs requires rapid-authenticating, costless, and more than anythings, high-security technology. Recent advances in nanotechnology accelerate developments of nanotag identifiers. Thinking of rapidness and high security in authentication, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) produced from well-designed noble metal nanostructure is promised to apply new authentication method. We have developed SERS active nanostructures by self-assembling of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) with Raman active reporting molecules. A few nanogram amounts of the AuNP assembles were directly deposited onto commercial tablet Mucodyne. For on-dose authentication outside of a laboratory, 80 g weight and smart-phone driven palm-top Raman detector was used. Shelf-life in SERS activity of the AuNP self-assemble liquid stocked at room temperature was over six months. The nanotag labeled Mucodyne tablet showed special SERS signal derived from the reporting molecule, and 0.2 s irradiation of 785 nm (5 mW) laser was enough to produce distinguishable SERS spectra from intact tablet. Excellent longevity of SERS signal over three years on the labeled tablets was confirmed. By just 0.2 second laser irradiation with a palmtop Raman spectrometer, rapid on-dose authentication was successfully achieved.},

We have Implemented, the process made on Chrominance signal (|C|) with the help of simulator, Lab VIEW 9, made by National Instruments in 1986. The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how NTSC System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is different from the PAL-D system used in Asian Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. The amount of digital information and the number of digital services are increasing explosively, and being beyond the human ability to use such massive information and services by direct operations on computers/devices. As a user, one may not know exactly what is the most needed, among which is the most suitable, and where is the best place to go in the digitally explosive world. In recent years, autonomic computing, context-aware computing, human-centric computing and so on have been proposed to make computers/devices capable of taking automatic responses according to users' states, preferences, ambient information, etc. Individual-aware computing is a computing paradigm based on the digital clone, called Cyber-Individual or Cyber-I, which is a correspondent of a real individual (Real-I). Cyber-I is far beyond merely a user model or a software agent to assist a user. It is aimed at providing the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of individual's experience, behavior and thinking as well as its birth, growth, and death. Cyber-I enables a Real-I to have a new form of existence in the cyber world and exhibit symbiosis with the Real-I. A Real-I's abilities may be continuously extended with increasing services or applications based on the Cyber-I. Individual-aware computing and Cyber-I are to aggregate multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies as well as a variety of technologies for realizing the harmony of humans, computers, and things.},

  abstract={Shoulder has a wide range of motion. Contact point between the glenoid and the humeral head, tension of soft tissue, and alignment of muscles connecting the bones drastically change in its range of motion. Mechanism stabilizing shoulder joint is influenced by arm positioning. Assessment of joint stability should always take arm positioning into consideration. In fact, there is a subtle instability which can only be detected when the arm is elevated. The glenoid dysplasia might be a cause for its instability. These findings can be detected only by 3D computer generated images except in some typical cases. Generally, joint stability is judged by location of the humeral head center in the glenoid. More intricate approach is necessary for some disorders. Analysis of contact area and other glenohumeral relation can clarify instability which cannot be detected through investigating location of joint center. The studies using those parameters showed that the joint is inherently unstable with the arm externally rotated at 90 degrees of elevation, and that joint positioning would be more apt to be affected from the cocking to the acceleration phase during throwing activity. We think such instability might lead to throwing disorders.},

In past some decades devices on which streaming is done have been transformed totally from televisions to OTTs which stream a large amount of content. Also, various electronic gadgets like laptops, tablets etc. provide ease to users to watch the content with portable facility. It has been noted that among all the sites browsed, streaming websites/services holds around 60% of all. The basic idea behind implementing the modules is that some content is widely available over the internet and is accessible to everyone irrespective of their age.

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={11-15},
  abstract={Prof. LotfiAskarZadeh had revolutionized the field of logics by proposing a novel logic, Fuzzy Logic, in 1965 where there is smooth transition between different classes due to overlapping of membership functions, and each element in fuzzy set has a degree of membership. Fuzzy Logic was considered appropriate to represent any vague or ambiguous situation of the real life problems. It also has the provision of allowing linguistic variables whose truth values may vary between 0 and 1; in contrast to two values of classical logic. Quite recently, Neutrosophic Logic was proposed by Florentine Smarandache, which is based on non-standard analysis that was given by Abraham Robinson in 1960s. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty, vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, undefined, unknown, incompleteness, inconsistency, redundancy, and contradiction that encompasses the shortcomings of every other logic studied in the past. All the factors stated are very integral to human thinking, as it is very rare that we tend to conclude/judge in definite environments, imprecision of human systems could be due to the imperfection of knowledge that human receives (observation) from the external world. Imperfection leads to a doubt about the value of a variable, a decision to be taken or a conclusion to be drawn for the actual system. Multiple factors could lead to uncertainty like incomplete knowledge (ignorance of the totality, limited view on a system because of its complexity), stochasticity (the case of intrinsic imperfection where a typical and single value does not exist), or the acquisition errors (intrinsically imperfect observations, the quantitative errors in measures). This talk would focus on the overlapping regions of the fuzzy systems in which a method has been proposed for using neutrosophic logic and assign a triplet of the form (t, i, f) for the points that are spanned by overlapping ranges, in such a way that every such output is assigned a true, indeterminate and false value.},

Firstly, targets are selected whose distances of latitude or longitude are less than a certain threshold value.

  abstract={Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become popular for their versatility and flexibility in implementing various digital circuits. An FPGA-VLSI processor's effectiveness is directly proportional to the speed with which its various digital signal processing operations may be carried out. The goal of this technique is to attain both a high level of accuracy and a high rate of speed. Approximate multipliers (AP) are among the fastest multipliers that are available and are used in FPGA-VLSI systems that are based on artificial intelligence (AI). A 64-bit multiplicator can be approximated with a 64-bit number thanks to the study that was suggested. We are employing the partial product or dada based multiplication technique to implement the suggested 64 bit digital approximate multiplier. This technique allows the 64 bit multiplication operation to be completed in the partial form. 64 bits multiplied by 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 bits respectively after being broken up. We are thinking about performance characteristics like the area, the latency, and the PDP right now.

  abstract={Summary form only given. I will review the past and present of “education for CIVEMSA and CIVEMSA for education”, then offer a few suggestions about where their futures might lie. The evolution of computer technology and the evolution of our thinking about its role in classrooms and teaching laboratories provide a natural timeline. There is also a spatial element to consider: as with the teaching of instrumentation and measurement itself, at any particular time distinct national and regional differences are apparent, and they are fairly weakly coupled, so taking a birds-eye view we get to observe multiple experiments running in parallel. Regarding the present and the foreseeable future, I would particularly like to review recent research that shows - it seems stronger than just “suggests” - that students who take notes on laptops learn less well than students who use pen-and-paper, and from there speculate a little about the consequent implications for CIVEMSA topics.},

I think that Wu and Ouyang's algorithm is perfect and hence it is entirely unnecessary that Chung uses calculus to yield equation (6) to examine the functional behavior of the joint annual total relevant cost function with respect to n. In addition, the four comments made in this note show that there is some room for improvement in relation to algebraically solving Wu and Ouyang's model so that the pedagogical advantages of model solution and problem evaluation are more eminent.},

Examining mental development is frequently utilized. Cancer in the cerebrum is a group of cells that replicate and grow strangely. Growth is made up of unwanted cells, which may be found in different parts of the brain, for example, the skull, arteries, glial cells, neurons, lymphatic tissue or metastasize from cancers found in different organs. When in doubt, development can be characterized into two classes, for instance, undermining (cancer-causing) and innocuous (non- destructive). The disruptive proof and ID of cerebrum development is incredible for MRI to imagine, nonetheless, the drawn-out and frightening work performed by clinical experts. This paper introduces systematic brain collection of MRI and recognition using differentiation (k-implies). The recommended strategy covers several stages. The recommended technique comprises a few phases, for example, preprocessing, filtration, and wavelet changes highlight extraction division and grouping. Here, the Median sifting strategy is used to preprocess the given picture for eliminating the commotion and afterward apply DWT to remove the GLCM highlights and grouping division to track down the growth region restriction.

  abstract={This paper is to explain about the picture in picture technology that is used innovatively for automated wireless home security. The present home security system needs an LCD screen that is located somewhere inside the home to view the camera video. At some point of time, consider the time when you are watching a very interesting program in the television, may be the last over of a T-20 match or the final minutes of a soccer match, your mind won't allow you to think of anything else than the ongoing match. At this circumstance, when anyone rings your door bell, naturally you won't mind that, whoever the guest may be. At another instance, if you are tired of attending unwelcomed guests n times, chances are there to neglect the guest at the n+1th time more consciously. If the guest at the door is an opportunity, it would be evidently missed. Our innovation to conquer this problem is, the video of the person standing at the door is made appeared at the television screen not by replacing the existing cable signal but as a pop up screen which covers a small portion of the TV screen. So, by noticing the pop up, one can decide which is vital - either the TV program or the guest. This pop up disappears automatically after a certain point of time when the guest leaves‥},

Just think of it, where light can be used as a medium of data communication and it is also a source of light (vision). How easy our work would be, the VLC technology is mostly used in indoor communication. The reason for this technology to evolve is the increasing number of crimes. In the present day, the number of internet users are more, there is no work done without the help of the internet. Due to this, the possibility of cyberattacks is more. Most of our personal data and confidential information is lost due to cyberattacks. The companies have faced a lot of financial losses because of it. The data transfer in VLC cannot be hacked easily. It is least prone for the attacks to take placeas communication is mostly indoors. In this paper, we have realized VLC in SISO and $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configurations. It is observed that the $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configuration outperforms SISO in terms of Bit error rate and Quality Factor.},

  abstract={Humans frequently communicate effectively using their faces in addition to their words. The use of computer vision techniques to categorize face emotion has been extensively studied. Given the difficulties and restrictions of databases, such as the use of static data or facial capture in artificial contexts, these have had different degrees of success. As a result, we think that novel preprocessing methods are necessary to increase the precision of facial expression detection models. In this study, we suggest a novel, yet straightforward, approach to improving the precision of face emotion identification. Our research was done using the FER2013 dataset, which includes static facial photos of 7 basic emotions. Resizing and Normalization image preprocessing techniques were applied on the dataset prior to the splitting into train and test sets. The training images were split into train and test sets in the ratios of 75% and 25% respectively. The facial expressions in the photos were classified using Convolution Neural Networks [CNNs], with an accuracy of 76.75% on the test set.},
