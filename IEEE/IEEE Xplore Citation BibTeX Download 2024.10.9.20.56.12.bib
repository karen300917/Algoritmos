  abstract={Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.},

  abstract={This paper describes the CSER Digital Technologies MOOC curriculum, which aims to build confidence and awareness of fundamental computational thinking skills for teachers within the K-6 context. The CSER MOOC builds upon recent advances in the development of the Australian Curriculum Digital Technologies learning area, which explicitly addresses the development of computational thinking skills, moving ICT education away from digital literacy towards embedding the skills needed for the next generation to become creators of technology. The CSER MOOC presents a broad coverage of core computational thinking concepts, with a focus on integrating with existing learning areas and appropriate pedagogy for the K-6 context. In this paper, we discuss our course curriculum, its alignment with key concepts from the formal curriculum statements, example teacher assessments, and discuss key challenges and concerns.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.},

  abstract={Based on the analysis of some famous instructional cases in programming education and in-depth interviews with primary school teachers who are engaged in programming education, this paper focuses on the instructional procedure and strategies of primary school programming education for cultivating students' computational thinking. This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.},

  abstract={Computation of time-dependent electromagnetic field excited by a varying current distribution is the hardcore of modern computational electromagnetism. However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.},

  abstract={Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the cultivation of computational skills and the enhancement of students' intellectual abilities remain of paramount importance. This research paper delves into the innovative approach of leveraging Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory to foster computational skills among high school students. The study specifically focuses on a group of 26 computer science high school students at N azarbayev Intellectual School in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The research employs a comprehensive and structured methodology that integrates MI principles into the classroom environment. Over a designated timeframe, students participate in a variety of activities designed to engage and stimulate each of their unique intelligences. Language, mathematics, spatial perception, motor skills, music, personal, and intrapersonal communication intelligences are all encompassed in these pursuits., creating a holistic learning experience. Data collection encompasses a multitude of measures, including pre- and post-assessments, observations, and student feedback, to gauge demonstrate the significant improvement in students' computational abilities following the MI-enhanced curriculum. In particular, students displayed increased problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability when confronted with computational challenges. The conclusion of this study contribute significant analysis into the potential of MI theory to transform traditional computer science education. By providing a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that nurtures students' diverse intellectual strengths, educators can empower learners to excel in computational disciplines. This research paper encourages further exploration of MI- based strategies to enhance computational abilities and inspires a shift towards more personalized and inspires a shift towards more personalized and effective teaching methodologies.},

  abstract={In the context of digitalization, employing the dual-diamond model design thinking, we dissect the design of smart tourism systems to enhance user-centric experiences. Firstly, through a literature review, we delve into the concept and design process of the dual-diamond model while exploring the feasibility of digital technologies. Subsequently, harnessing the characteristics of the dual-diamond design thinking, we embark on the entire design process. During the exploration phase, we gather firsthand user pain points through user interviews, complemented by secondary data from the internet. This aids in constructing user journey maps and user models, defining user segments, and identifying design opportunities. Following this, we proceed with the functional reconstruction and interface prototyping of the smart tourism application, with a focus on features such as automated travel guides, visualized travel itineraries, panoramic guides, personalized travel companion searches, and intelligent user interactions. Conducting empirical design validation, we observed a high level of user satisfaction. Consequently, iterative design improvements were made, serving as a reference for future smart travel service promotion and development, thus advancing the growth of personalized tourism.},

  abstract={A series of unplugged programming courses based on game activities has been designed and developed to reduce the difficulty of programming courses in elementary school and to develop computational thinking skills in elementary school students. Four components were designed for the course: course objectives, course content, course activities, and course evaluation. A controlled experiment was performed to validate the course's influence on developing learners' computational thinking, and a questionnaire was employed to examine the experimental class learners' experience with the course. The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course.},

  abstract={This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines," using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

  abstract={In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on game development using Mixed Reality technology, the Magic Leap One device, by exploring with The Lab and Unreal Engine program that are developed in game interpolating Computational Thinking (CT). The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.},

  abstract={While specialized knowledge and skills are the hallmark of modern society, the size and complexity of contemporary problems often require cooperative effort to analyze and solve. Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration},

  abstract={Until now, significant R&D effort in the field of Computational Creativity, has been devoted towards understudying the elements of the creative process from idea conception to production, or towards designing machines which exhibit human level creativity without merely mimicking the human creative process. However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools. We subsequently exploited human-provided rankings of the stories in order to train a model for evaluating creativity as a combination of various characteristics of the produced stories.},

  abstract={The systematic solutions to planning and scheduling for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high complexity and strong randomness. This paper extended the past research on modeling CTLS with computer composition principles and architecture. The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance. Further, the model is used in studying 3 students in order to deduce biomarkers for understanding their psychological conditions.},

Data collected over the course of the fall 2014 and spring 2015 semesters involving 10 graduate fellows, 9 teachers, and over 200 K-12 students has been analyzed. A single assessment was issued at the beginning and end of each semester in order to track metrics about fellow-teacher pairings, student understanding of CT concepts, and student interest in STEM+C areas. Using statistical analysis software to evaluate the data, we were able to determine the efficacy of the DISSECT program. In particular, we use descriptive statistics to evaluate the trends in CT vocabulary recognition and overall interest in computing, and we compare trends across courses and grade levels.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.},

  abstract={The manual assessment of creativity by human raters is coupled with unavoidable subjectivity and often costs much time and human resources. To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.},

  abstract={Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.},

  abstract={Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.},

  abstract={This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill},

  abstract={Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.},

  abstract={In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.},

  abstract={Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.},

President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track. The aim of this work is to test if using a hybrid approach for teaching K-12 students programming by combining both software and hardware techniques is more effective than using a singleton approach.},

  abstract={Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.},

  abstract={Research-based learning (RBL) familiarizes students with the academic research process at an early stage and at the same time offers them the opportunity to actively shape their own learning process. Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper introduces a model for structuring playful, challenge-based learning activities drawing on a process of decontextualisation of a challenge to access its Computational Thinking intellectual and conceptual components and subsequent computationalisation of these components into computational artifacts that are recontextualised to render them attractive and accessible to school pupils. The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={148-153},
  abstract={The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.},

In this study, we aim to verify whether the SW education program has a significant effect on computational thinking and communication skills by using the communication-centered model (C-UMC), which centers on ‘communication’ as one of the characteristics of the metaverse. The SW education program applied in this study targets 23 high school students and is conducted for 16 sessions (2 hours × 8 sessions). This study is an ongoing research, and we presented the design process for conducting the study, as well as the current classroom process and preliminary results. For further study, we will perform an effectiveness analysis on whether there was a significant difference in learners' computational thinking and communication skills.},

  year={2014},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={360-364},
  abstract={In this paper, we describe on-going work on the ensemble of two models for computational creativity using commonsense knowledge. The GENCAD model of computational creativity proposes the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that employs a population of exemplars as a starting point for its search, unlike traditional EAs, which employ a randomly-generated initial population. The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so. To confirm that the generated plots make sense, the hybrid model integrates commonsense knowledge into its evaluation module.},

  abstract={Student who possess several qualities of intelligence and critical thinking skills are believed to think independently. To develop overall skills for a student, it is required that a student demonstrate his knowledge, skills, and abilities in a various ways i.e., through multiple choice questions, fill the gaps, problem solving, short and long answers. Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed. This paper highlights drawbacks/difficulties with automatic short answers grading. Authors tried to discuss the scope for researchers in this field of automated grading using machine learning algorithms. Authors recommend researchers to conduct an experiment in hybrid and feedback supported systems for grading answers.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision&#x2010;makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, &#x2018;systemic critique&#x2019;, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, &#x2018;systemic pluralism&#x2019;, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, &#x2018;systemic improvement&#x2019;, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to &#x2018;systemic pragmatism&#x2019;. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>},

In addition, noncore programming elements, including sound and look, are widely adapted across various math topics and contribute significantly to project popularity. Although some studies discussed the integration of computation thinking (CT) and math in the classrooms, scant research focuses on the effect of math topics on CT element adoption for achieving better integration in the creative learning context.

  abstract={Can digital competencies be acquired by solving real problems? The educational intervention MadeByKids called an external educational provider to 17 schools to conduct a series of workshops, having pupils age 7 - 12 solve challenges such as designing the schoolbag 4.0 or the future classroom. The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.},

  abstract={This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context.},

  abstract={While programming has been recognized as an engaging way to enhance students’ learning, implementing programming in K-12 education remains challenging, particularly when it requires access to digital devices or the internet. Therefore, it’s essential to consider more accessible methods for teaching crucial programming skills. Given this situation, we turned to unplugged computational thinking (CT) activities to foster interest and develop skills in programming. By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills. An overall findings implied that the unplugged CT activities enhanced students’ understanding of CT as well as improved their interest and programming skills.},

  abstract={The advancement in Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) technology resulted in accurate and high-performance miniature device systems. These devices are so tiny that they are not noticeable by the human eye and exhibit excellent feasibility in miniaturization sensors due to their small dimensions, low power consumption, and superior performance. The area of sci-ence and engineering where MEMS are developed (dimensions in the manometer scale) is called Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is one of the fastest growing scientific research related to Industry 4.0. Nanotechnology may introduce industrial skills deficits as well as opportunities for new teaching practices in several subjects and educational frameworks. In the present work, we investigate the attitude of STEM (i.e. technology/engineering) and non STEM - related instructors, regarding the integration of Nanotechnology applications in Higher education curricula. Their opinions, concerning the applied teaching method, the learning content material and expected student skills, should always be taken in to account, as they may boost any reformations proposed. Moreover, we propose a repository platform, with which instructors may interact with 3D designs and MEMs mate-rial to built their didactic plans. This work's findings is critical for the design and innovative training material and computational thinking (CT) activities, which will prepare student with skills related to Industry 4.0 demand.},

  abstract={Digital tools have become more essential in education and business areas these days and it is important to start in the early stages of education, e.g. already in the preschool stage. This paper describes the development and pilot testing of an Android based serious gaming App for mobile devices called Pic2Program. The App aims to teach children the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) in a playful way. The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders. The results show that students find the App well-structured and help them to understand the basics of programming.},

  abstract={Aspiring software developers, like the novice students in Computer Science courses, need to acquire a thorough understanding of fundamental computational concepts like sequential execution, conditional branching, loops, modularisation, hierarchy and reuse. This understanding and "computational thinking" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to understand the human mind functions such that we can simulate them into a computational model for making cognitive systems more intelligent. We then present this model with formulae using a top-down approach. We propose that the human thought process, which is the fundamental unit for the human mind and all the different emotions coming from it, can be implemented as a mathematical formula to a reasonable extent. Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking. The model utilizes a top-down approach for understanding the factors involved in the thought process while explaining the factors involved. The authors are intending to make continuous improvements in the formulae as more scientific advances happen in the understanding of the human cognitive functions.},

  title={When Does Collaborative Interaction Support Learning of Computational Thinking Among Undergraduate Students}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a new model of artificial cognitive architecture for intelligent systems, the Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture (NEUCOGAR). The model is bio mimetically inspired and adapts the neuromodulators role of human brains into computational environments. This way we aim at achieving more efficient Artificial Intelligence solutions based on the biological inspiration of the deep functioning of human brain, which is highly emotional. The analysis of new data obtained from neurology, psychology philosophy and anthropology allows us to generate a mapping of monoamine neuro modulators and to apply it to computational system parameters. Artificial cognitive systems can then better perform complex tasks (regarding information selection and discrimination, attention, innovation, creativity) as well as engaging in affordable emotional relationships with human users.},

  abstract={Quantum mechanics is a revolutionary scientific field, which lies at the crossroad section of Physics, Mathematics, Computer and Computational Science. In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.},

  year={2019},
  volume={62},
  number={4},
  pages={325-332},
  abstract={Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.},

Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.},

The approach is elaborated and illustrated by experimental work in the area of conceptual design. We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.},

Then it presents our work in the field of computational musicology. Computational musicology is broadly defined as the study of music with computational modelling and simulation. We are interested in developing A-Life-based models to study the evolution of musical cognition in an artificial society of agents.

In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre-and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.},

  abstract={This research paper determines how education can be optimized by mapping curricula onto Bloom’s taxonomy. The cyber security industry has disparate ways of recruiting its workforce owing to the prevailing educational system and diverse work roles in the field of cyber security. Comparison is drawn between the old and revised models of Bloom’s taxonomy to depict which model best represents the dynamic learning objectives and outcomes of cyber security education. A rubric is designed from the Dreyfus et al model of skill acquisition based on the iterations of Bloom’s taxonomy to assess cyber security competencies to achieve mastery. To bridge the skills gaps in the industry, Bloom’s taxonomy provides the impetus to align the needs of industry with educational programs [1].},

  abstract={Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution. The advancement of deep learning algorithms can potentially help improve lung cancer detection with low-dose CT scans.},

  abstract={This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been dubbed as a fundamental skill for the 21st century and can be learned by all. However, little research exists on the practical use of CT in daily life. Therefore, this problem was addressed by applying a design science research approach and situational method engineering to propose an artefact that can help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the problem-solving process using CT and the Work System Method (WSM). The resulting artefact offers a systematic way of problem-solving process and allows SMEs to discover process innovation.

In addition, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify a specific research need. In the proposed framework, this study emphasized more that CT is implemented as an approach to attract the involvement of students in STEM education through the framework.

  abstract={This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.},

  pages={1-2},
  abstract={While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

To do this, two concepts are explored. The first, ‘serendipity engineering for seductive hypermedia,’ looks at how to design information systems to account for the pleasant occurrences that happen in offline environments studied by those in sales and marketing where beneficial outcomes often occur by chance encounters. The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system. The parametric model presented has great applicability for information and communications technology solution providers.},

  abstract={With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, a myriad of guides are being published to support educators who are teaching this subject, often for the first time. Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.},

Expanding upon CT definitions, industry practices and processes, and educational theory, we link existing concepts and propose a new element to model an active definition of CT as a theoretical framework to guide future research. Our model updates existing CT definition by formally including Modeling, introducing Socio-Technical processes, separating Information Gathering from Data Collection and adding emphasis to Testing as a vital CT concept.

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper deals with the difficulty that it is possible to teach computational thinking through the teaching of algorithms and programming to a person with ADD. We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications.},

  pages={282-291},
  abstract={Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).},
