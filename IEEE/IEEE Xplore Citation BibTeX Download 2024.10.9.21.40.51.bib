  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is successfully intervening in areas such as education, health and industry. In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.},

  abstract={Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.},

  abstract={There is a growing literature demonstrating the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the process of learning computational thinking and the foundational aspects of computer science. While Collaborative Virtual Environments are becoming widespread in the software development professional domain and in various areas of advanced learning, their use in the introductory stages of learning computing is still very limited. On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a blooming of attractive programming environments specifically designed to expose young students (e.g., middle school age) to computational thinking. Alice is a very popular introductory programming environment, focused on programming through animations and story-telling. This paper introduces a novel extension of the Alice framework that enables interaction and collaboration among students in the development of programs. In particular, the new version of Alice described in this paper provides support for virtual pair programming. The modified version of Alice allows two students to remotely share a virtual world, and interact in its construction; the system supports roles assignments, to allow teachers to control activities and contributions of the two students in the creation of a programming project.},

Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. This paper introduces a block-based learning environment for C programming language using web services. The environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. The programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on.},

  abstract={In a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) etc. The rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board.},

The simulation/game modeling and making tasks acted as the primers of practicing and assessing representational flexibility in solving the engineering design problems with computational thinking. The participants' participation behaviors and verbal utterances during the intervention sessions have been archived via screen and webcam recordings. The current study findings indicated that two approaches of speech or text data mining, multi-label classification and similarity index, can act as the in-situ performance assessment methods to evaluate the representational flexibility development for engineering design and computational thinking of a heterogeneous learner group.},

  abstract={This research explores the psychology of programming and the pedagogical environment in a certificate granting urban immigrant engineer retraining program in New York City. The program is aimed at teaching under-represented immigrant engineer students to learn how to program in the Java programming language. The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research.},

  abstract={Schools are increasingly integrating character education to facilitate improved moral thinking and pro social behavior among students. An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes. However, schools are rarely able to use animated vignettes since existing tools do not allow them to be easily created and having them created externally is overly expensive. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool’s multimedia features are often used and well-liked. Educators can download and use our tool while researchers can draw upon our design rationale and lessons learned when building similar tools.},

  title={Enculturation of Students to Engineering and COVID's Impact Associated}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.},

Learning representations is critical for machine learning and very computation-intensive process. There are many opportunities to introduce efficiencies through parallel and distributed computing. The success of machine learning algorithms depends on data representation. Different representations can expose or hide different features of the data. As we think about the future of learning representations and its impact on machine learning it is important to consider the state of the art of machine learning today, the challenges and opportunities for addressing the computation issues around representation learning, and how to get to deeper understanding and more capabilities in machine learned models. In this talk I will describe 4 ideas related to computational issues in representation learning: reducing uncertainty, developing compact representations, debasing the training data, and developing privacy-preserving representations.},

  abstract={6G is currently under definition, often being addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.},

  title={Engineering Student Perspectives of a New Required Programming Course}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.},

  abstract={At present, conveyor belt tearing is the most serious fault of belt conveyor, causing the greatest loss. This paper aims to overcome the issues of poor accuracy, low precision, and poor real-time performance in the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor. Specifically, this paper presents a method of longitudinal tear detection of conveyor belt based on the sound signal. According to the recognition of the tearing sound signal, the longitudinal tearing of conveyor belt can be detected. A dynamic MFCC feature extraction method is proposed to extract the sound signal feature. An improved DenseNet neural network model is designed, which is used to classify the longitudinal sound of the belt conveyor to realize the longitudinal tearing detection of the conveyor belt.The experimental results demonstrate that the method in this paper achieves the sound detection of the longitudinal tear of the conveyor belt, and the average accuracy of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor reaches 95.42%, which satisfies the requirements of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor.Applying this method to the longitudinal tearing detection of conveyor belt can solve the shortcomings of existing methods and realize the detection of the longitudinal tearing fault of conveyor belt.},

  abstract={Accurate carbon price prediction can help save energy and reduce emissions worldwide. Thus, this paper proposes a model that combines swarm intelligence algorithms with deep learning to predict carbon prices. In this model, we collect news related to carbon trading, construct a dictionary of carbon financial sentiment, and determine the emotional value of the carbon news. Secondly, The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is improved by updating the escape energy and introducing the inertia weight. Then, the LSTM is optimized using the improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO) algorithm. Finally, technical and emotional data on carbon price as multiple source input values are integrated, and the MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model is established. The results show that the MAPE of IHHO-LSTM is 1.89%, 30.48%, and 10.30% better than that of HHO-LSTM in Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen Carbon Exchanges, respectively. Similarly, MS-IHHO-LSTM showed a lower MAPE than IHHO-LSTM by 27.79%, 29.82%, and 6.33% in the corresponding regions. The results of the experiment indicate that: 1) Using IHHO to optimize LSTM hyperparameters can avoid falling into local optimal and improve prediction accuracy; 2) Incorporating emotional values can further enhance the model’s performance. The MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model facilitates low-carbon investment, technological innovation, and green production, enabling enterprises to support environmental sustainability.},

  pages={24453-24464},
  abstract={The complex environmental influences often complicate the detection of longitudinal tears in conveyor belts, resulting in insufficient detection accuracy, overlooked detection, and elevated false detection rates. In this study, we propose a new depth learning method specifically designed for detecting longitudinal tears in conveyor belts. This method employs a linear Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to capture images of the conveyor belt. These images are subsequently processed with a modified version of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v7 model to identify instances of longitudinal tearing. The modified YOLOv7 model features Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss function as a substitute for the original loss function. Furthermore, a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) is introduced in the detection head to improve detection accuracy. In this method, we introduced the SimSPPFCSPC module as a new spatial pyramid pooling model. This module enhances detection speed while maintaining detection accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an impressive precision of 94.6% and a detection speed of approximately 110 Frames Per Second (FPS). Such accuracy and speed meet the requirements for online detection of longitudinal tearing in belt conveyors.},

  pages={101528-101535},
  abstract={The main challenge of pose estimation for six degrees of freedom (6DoF) is the lack of labeled data in real environment. In order to overcome this problem, many studies recently have trained deep learning models with synthetic data. However, a domain gap between real and synthetic environments exists, prompting various approaches to address this issue. In this work, we propose domain adaptation for self-supervised 6DoF pose estimation, which leverages the components and introduces an effective method to reduce domain discrepancy. First, we adopt a multi-level domain adaptation module, on image level and instance level, to learn domain-invariant features. Second, we used entropy-based alignment to minimize the entropy of representation embedding. Finally, we evaluate our approach on LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD datasets. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves higher performance compared to the prior methods and demonstrate effectiveness in domain shift scenarios on 6DoF pose estimation.},

  abstract={Data science and high-performance computing (HPC) should be a great match: with datasets growing well beyond the memory of a single node and computations becoming ever more communication-intensive, the need for HPC in data science seems clear. And yet, there remains a frustrating gap between the two disciplines. One major reason is that data science is an interactive sport-data scientists overwhelmingly gravitate towards interactive platforms (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) and interpreted languages (e.g., Python)-whereas the culture of HPC tends to eschew interactivity in favor of compiled programs and batch jobs. While HPC practitioners prize computational efficiency, data scientists live by the very different maxim of rapid hypothesis testing and have demonstrated that they are willing to ignore HPC technologies entirely rather than give up interactivity. Bridging this gap entails a change in thinking about the purpose of an HPC and how it should be used. This talk motivates and demonstrates the interactive use of up to hundreds of HPC nodes in data science workflows with an open-source package called Arkouda, which exposes massively parallel, distributed NumPy-like arrays to a Jupyter notebook running Python 3. We have chosen the NumPy format and Jupyter and Python as front-end technologies in order to conform to interfaces familiar to data scientists. Because Arkouda arrays can be constructed from and exported to NumPy arrays, users can perform heavy computations on hundreds of HPC nodes and bring back small sets of results for rich introspection in a single-node Python environment. In the future, we plan to use this interoperability as a template for bringing existing HPC codes into an interactive framework, much as NumPy has brought optimized C and Fortran routines into interactive Python workflows. Meanwhile, the computational heart of Arkouda is a relatively compact yet highly scalable Chapel interpreter that implements a powerful set of data science primitives. Functionally, this interpreter comprises a dispatcher, modular data transformations, and a zero-copy, in-memory object store, all implemented in about 12,000 lines of Chapel. While these components and design principles appear in other open-source projects, the competitive advantage of Arkouda comes from the unique position Chapel holds as a productive language with performance and scaling on par with industry-standard HPC technologies. For this reason, Arkouda is small enough to be maintainable while achieving good scaling on communication-intensive primitives (e.g., argsort) up to at least 512 nodes of a Cray XC.},

  abstract={Developers must revise current approaches to standards for analysis software to account for its unique characteristics. When developers think of software standards, they envision software for aircraft cockpits, nuclear reactors, high-speed trains, medical devices, and spacecraft: software that directly controls some component related to the product's safe operation, with or without a person in the loop. Standards for such safety-critical software that have evolved over the past two decades make specific assumptions about the software's development environment. If the software provides computational data that is wrong, and the resulting decision based on that data is faulty, safety is compromised. The software itself is not safety-critical. Nevertheless, safety is involved, sometimes with a lengthy time component and many people in the loop. As with safety-critical software, certain standards address the production of quality computational software or, as it is often called, analysis software. Standards for developing analysis software are based on standards used for other software types. However, the characteristics of analysis software are very different.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. We are at a novel crossroads in technology where we are witnessing the confluence of computing, communicating and networking. A number of exciting applications are both driving and being driven by this confluence, including low-power sensor networks, large-scale ad hoc wireless networks, and wireless multimedia transmission. Many of these applications demand a move away from classical centralized architectures and algorithms towards more decentralized and distributed ones. Signal processing plays a key role in this revolution- not in isolation but rather as a pivotal interdisciplinary systems component, intimately integrated with communications, information theory, coding theory, and networking protocols. Sensor networks represent a particularly rich applications base. We would provide a snapshot of the sensor network related activities in a number of research groups at Berkeley. Motivated by the communications and computational constraints imposed by large-scale low-power sensor networks, we would describe some of our signal processing centric research including: (i) distributed sampling; (ii) distributed source coding; (iii) distributed estimation; and (iv) robust transmission. We would highlight the key foundational role played by multi-user information theory, particularly the so-called area of side-information coding for both source coding (compression) and channel coding (transmission). A deeper look reveals a beautiful functional duality between source and channel coding with side-information. This unexpectedly unifies a host of seemingly unrelated problem areas like distributed compression, digital watermarking, multimedia transmission over packet-error networks, and seamless digital upgrade of analog TV. Finally, as a microcosm of the expressive power of interdisciplinary thinking, we would describe a novel video compression paradigm dubbed PRISM (power-efficient, robust, hlh-compression, syndrome-based multimedia coding). PRISM's architecture, in stark contrast to that driving current video codecs like MPEG, allows for a novel shifting of the computational complexity from the encoder to the decoder, making it ideally suited for "uplink" transmission scenarios in wireless multimedia and surveillance applications.},

  abstract={As reproducible research tools and skills become increasingly in-demand across disciplines, so too does the need for innovative and collaborative training. While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.},

  abstract={Molecular programming of DNA makes use of computeraided design, a programming language to encode the design, and a a compiler that compiles the code into a list of corresponding DNA strands. To implement the code, the developer orders the DNA from a supplier and then runs the molecular program in the laboratory. Instruments such as spectrofluorometers and atomic force microscopes help verify that the molecular program ran correctly, self-assembling to achieve the intended structure and behavior. Applications of molecular programming that are on the horizon for commercial production include targeted and personalized medical applications, biosensors for air and water, molecular robots that can navigate in cells, and biocompatible computational devices. In this talk I describe the experiences and results of our interdisciplinary team in applying goal-oriented requirements techniques, reaction network modeling, and probabilistic model checking to molecular programmed nanosystems. Requirements challenges include handling scalability to very large numbers of devices or services (roughly similar to the internet of things), dealing with probabilistic behavior, and understanding the limits of safe operation in changing (literally fluid) environments. I discuss how computational tools and thinking assist the development efforts and what limitations currently hamper our requirements analysis in practice. More broadly, I suggest that the approaches useful for molecular programming may help with understanding the requirements for other large, distributed, autonomous systems.},

  title={Distinguishing single-stranded and double-stranded DNA binding proteins based on structural information}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={612-612},
  abstract={Protein-DNA interactions play a critical role in many biological processes. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. DNA binding proteins can be classified into double-stranded DNA binding proteins (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). Understanding the binding specificity of a DNA binding protein is helpful for the research of protein functions. Though there are some researches [1] on the SSB and DSB respectively, few attentions have been paid on investigating what makes SSB and DSB have such different ability of the specific binding. With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of proteins has been sequenced. However, SSBs have shown to have little sequence conservation [2]. Even DSBs involved in similar functions may have conserved subsequences, different kinds of DSBs with different functions seems to show few common subsequences. Therefore, it is hard to recognize SSB sequences from DSB sequences, or vice versa. In fact, up to Jan. 25, 2013, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] contains 3391 structures for DNA binding proteins, among them only about 30% and 5% are annotated as DSBs and SSBs, respectively, and whether the remainders belong to DSBs or SSBs are still not very clear. Therefore, a computational method is required to annotate the DNA binding protein as DSB or SSB automatically. The surface of a protein is generally irregular, containing many clefts and grooves of varying shapes and sizes. Previous researches have shown that a large cleft can provide an increased opportunity for the protein to form interactions with other molecules, particularly small ligands [4]. Therefore, some researches used a particularly large and deep cleft to characterize the binding active sites of the proteins [5]. We guess that for DNA binding proteins, the cleft properties on the surface may also play important roles on the dsDNA/ssDNA binding specificity. In this work, we applied CAVER 3.0 package [6] to detect the clefts and the corresponding indexes of the largest clefts on the protein surfaces, to investigate whether they are possible to be used for distinguishing the potential interfaces between SSBs and DSBs. Concretely, we mainly got three indexes of the detected tunnels: length, curvature and bottleneck radius. Research results have shown that although the sequences of different SSBs are very different, there are well-conserved elements in the structures. That is, most SSBs contain one or more OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) - fold domains [2]. A typical OB-fold has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The OB-fold plays critical role in binding with ssDNA. Although it is hard to say that the OB-fold is unique for SSBs, we think that it should also be used as an important descriptor to distinguish SSBs from DSBs. Therefore, we use the protein structure alignment package TM-align [7] to compare its structure with each of the six OB-fold protein templates and use the maximal alignment score TM-score as the OB-fold feature of the protein. We aim to investigate the structural differences between collected SSBs and DSBs, and extract the structure-based features related to surface clefts and OB-folds, Based on which, we construct a computational model that can automatically classify the DNA protein as a DSB or SSB by using the widely used support vector machine (SVM), with prediction accuracy of HOLO-set 0.87, APO-set 0.83, and mixed-set 0.83, respectively. The promising performance suggests that our method will be useful in the protein function annotation and refinement.

  abstract={In the field of storytelling and filmmaking, we are often aware of the viewer's subjective state, such as emotional state and so on. A similar concept is direction, which is often accumulated by the heuristic findings of creators. The issue is that the emotional state of the viewer is subjective, making it hard for computational approach. Our approach is utilizing appraisal trajectory. The appraisal trajectory is a line chart drawn the viewer's own emotional state from the beginning to the end of the content. We think that the appraisal trajectory enables us to handle the viewer's emotional state with a computer. We think to need accumulate basic findings about subjective trajectories; therefore, we develop a tool to collect subjective trajectories: emonotate. This tool provides some features: input and store the various emotional states of viewers and viewers intuitively agreeable input by visual feedback of arbitrary appraisal trajectories. In order to evaluate the validity, we conduct the experiment of 104 participants drawing subjective trajectories based on protagonist emotional state about 2 animation contents and the subjective quantity is the protagonist emotional state. Both works yielded intuitively correct results, demonstrating the realism of our tool. We think our experimental facts indicate the possibility of our tool collecting subjective trajectories and the issues.},

  abstract={An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look at general challenges and discusses categorization, extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the broader implications that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services have: questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation, and whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in opinion-oriented information-seeking systems.},

The collaborated universities developed an optimal curriculum to enhance and nurture students' "Future Work Skills 2020" defined by the Institute for the Future, such future human skills as Sense Making, Social Intelligence, Novel & Adaptive Thinking, Cross-Cultural Competencies, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, Transdisciplinarity, Design Mindset, Cognitive Load Management, and Virtual Collaboration. The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on "the same page" in the progress of the project throughout the course. Further, the assessment strategies to enhance students' efficacy is the key factor in the course, which is also discussed with examples. This paper reports the global PBL active learning curriculum and environment collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University.},

  abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

  abstract={Software engineering for mobile applications has its own challenges, different from when we engineer software just for desktop environments. With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey’s questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.},

  abstract={Nowadays, there has been a rapid evolution and transformation of technology. Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.},

  pages={35-45},
  abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used to deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Compared with fuzzy linguistic approaches, they are more convenient and flexible to reflect the DMs' preferences in decision making. For further applications of HFLTSs to decision making, we develop a concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) as a tool to collect and present the DMs' preferences. Due to the importance of the consistency measures using preference relations in decision making, we develop some consistency measures for HFLPRs to ensure that the DMs are being neither random nor illogical. A consistency index is defined to establish the consistency thresholds of HFLPRs to measure whether an HFLPR is of acceptable consistency. For HFLPRs with unacceptable consistency, we develop two optimization methods to improve the consistency until they are acceptable. Several illustrative examples are given to validate the consistency measures and the optimization methods.},

  pages={181-193},
  abstract={In this paper, new learning methods tolerant to imprecision are introduced and applied to fuzzy modeling based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system. The fuzzy modeling has an intrinsic inconsistency. It may perform thinking tolerant to imprecision, but learning methods are zero-tolerant to imprecision. The proposed methods make it possible to exclude this intrinsic inconsistency of a fuzzy modeling, where zero-tolerance learning is used to obtain fuzzy model tolerant to imprecision. These new methods can be called /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning or /spl epsiv/ learning, where, in order to fit the fuzzy model to real data, the /spl epsiv/-insensitive loss function is used. This leads to a weighted or "fuzzified" version of Vapnik's support vector regression machine. This paper introduces two approaches to solving the /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning problem. The first approach leads to the quadratic programming problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. The second approach leads to a problem of solving a system of linear inequalities. Two computationally efficient numerical methods for the /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning are proposed. The /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning leads to a model with the minimal Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, which results in an improved generalization ability of this model and its outliers robustness. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the introduced methods.},

The propagation of waves on the non-uniform walls to have different amplitudes and phase but the same wave speed is produced the tapered asymmetric channel. The equations of dimensionless temperature and nanoparticle concentration are solved analytically under assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The governing equations of momentum of a hyperbolic tangent nanofluid for the tapered asymmetric channel have also been solved analytically using the regular perturbation method. The expression for average rise in pressure has been figured using numerical integrations. The effects of various physical parameters entering into the problem are discussed numerically and graphically. The phenomenon of trapping is also investigated. Furthermore, the received results show that the maximum pressure rise gets increased in case of non-Newtonian fluid when equated with Newtonian fluid.},

  year={2023},
  volume={31},
  number={8},
  pages={2773-2787},
  abstract={The three-way decision theory provides a three-way philosophical thinking to solve problems, and the regret theory quantifies the risk preferences of decision makers under different psychological behaviors. On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.},

  title={A Genetic Fuzzy Linguistic Combination Method for Fuzzy Rule-Based Multiclassifiers}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={21},
  number={5},
  pages={950-965},
  abstract={Fuzzy set theory has been widely and successfully used as a mathematical tool to combine the outputs provided by the individual classifiers in a multiclassification system by means of a fuzzy aggregation operator. However, to the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy combination method has been proposed, which is composed of a fuzzy rule-based system. We think this can be a very promising research line as it allows us to benefit from the key advantage of fuzzy systems, i.e., their interpretability. By using a fuzzy linguistic rule-based classification system as a combination method, the resulting classifier ensemble would show a hierarchical structure, and the operation of the latter component would be transparent to the user. Moreover, for the specific case of fuzzy multiclassification systems, the new approach could also become a smart way to allow standard fuzzy classifiers to deal with high-dimensional problems, avoiding the curse of dimensionality, as the chance to perform classifier selection at class level is also incorporated, into the method. We conduct comprehensive experiments considering 20 UCI datasets with different dimensionality, where our approach improves or at least maintains accuracy, while reducing complexity of the system, and provides some interpretability insight into the multiclassification system reasoning mechanism. The results obtained show that this approach is able to compete with the state-of-the-art multiclassification system selection and fusion methods in terms of accuracy, thus providing a good interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.},

  title={Fuzzy Markov Decision-Making Model for Interference Effects}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={31},
  number={1},
  pages={199-212},
  abstract={The law of total probability plays an essential role in Bayesian reasoning, which has been used in many fields. However, some experiments show the law of total probability can be violated. In recent years, researchers have tried to explain this paradox with the interference effect in quantum theory, and they think the main reason for interference effects is the uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to effectively model and process the uncertain information in the decision-making process is very important to understand and predict the interference effects. Zadeh proposed the fuzzy set by considering the fuzziness of information. Later, Atanassov proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). IFS better describes the fuzzy information from the view of membership, nonmembership than fuzzy sets, which can also more flexibly simulate human decision making. Hence, the article proposed the fuzzy Markov decision-making model (FDM) under the framework of IFS to explain and predict the interference effects of decision-making process. In FDM, intuitionistic fuzzy number can be generated by using the negation operation of probability. In addition, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the Kolmogorov equation, which can consider the evolution time in the decision-making process. The transition matrix establishes the relationship between different stages to get the fuzzy numbers of final states. Finally, the article used the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to transform fuzzy number into the probability. In summary, the proposed FDM can provide a novel idea to explore and explain the interference effects in the decision-making process, which is helpful to promote the development of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={In standard situations, agents in a multi-agent community need to communicate each other to accomplish cooperation and coordination of joint activities. Normally it is expected that each agent can contact any other using a reliable communication infrastructure. Often one has to think about situations when a communication subsystem becomes disintegrated and some agents become isolated from the rest of the community. The paper provides basic analysis of such inaccessibility situations, and reviews possible technologies to remedy the resulting difficulties. The concepts of a so-called doubler agent and stand-in agent for maintaining agents accessibility is introduced. A brief discussion on suitability of the acquaintance models for maintaining accessibility on a symbolic level is also touched.},

We define the concepts of continuous hesitant fuzzy sets and continuous hesitant fuzzy functions. Based on these, we further explore definite line integrals of continuous hesitant fuzzy functions and their related properties. Two continuous hesitant fuzzy information integration models based on the hesitant fuzzy calculus are proposed. We also commit to revealing the internal connections between the first line integral model, the second line integral model, and the hesitant fuzzy weighted operator. We state why it is necessary to introduce novel aggregation models based on definite line integrals, and then provide applications of the proposed models to prove their validity and rationality. Finally, we compare the proposed models with other aggregation operators to further demonstrate their effectiveness and rationality.},

  title={FPGA-Based Fuzzy Logic Controllers Applied to the MPPT of PV Panels—A Systematic Review}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={32},
  number={8},
  pages={4260-4269},
  abstract={Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique for continuously extracting the largest amount of energy that a source can provide under varying conditions, and it is indispensable for modern photovoltaic (PV) panels. Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.},

  pages={3508-3520},
  abstract={Social networks are gaining importance as an important application landscape for machine learning techniques. Currently, it is prevalent thinking to introduce social networks into group decision-making research, despite exhibiting promising performance, there remain significant challenges, including 1) trust risk is often overlooked, and 2) group opinions are excessively relied upon. In this regard, this article introduces the trust risk test for group consensus (SN-TRT-GC) by using probabilistic linguistic preference relations under probabilistic linguistic term sets. The proposed method ensures that the expert's competence matches the discourse as much as possible by virtue of the trust risk value. Moreover, opinion evolution relies on the dual attributes of similarity and trust, which promote the exchange of opinions among experts and greatly accelerate the consensus reaching process. Empirical investigations of satisfaction surveys demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented SN-TRT-GC technique.},

  abstract={Normalized cut based image segmentation has a variety of applications in the area of image compression, medical imaging, mapping and measurements. But, the computational complexity of conventional normalized cut algorithm based on generalized eigenvalue problem is high. In this study, we proposed a simplified normalized cut algorithm using graph partitioning method for image segmentation. The computational cost of this simplified method are relatively low and hence, it can be implemented on real time embedded system applications. We have implemented an FPGA based image segmentation system using the simplified normalized cut algorithm and tested it for malarial parasites detection. Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL) is used to develop the system and implemented on FPGA Spartan-6 targeted device xc6slx16- 2csg324. The Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture is used to design the system. We think the proposed architecture can be useful for real time image segmentation.},

  abstract={An approximate parallel prefix adder is a type of circuit that can perform addition operations on binary numbers with extremely high speed, low latency, and much less power. Nowadays, thinking about fuzzy computing, that is, sacrificing computational expectations for computational efforts, has emerged as a promising graphical approach. Over the past decade, various research works have explored approximate computation at both the software level and the hardware abstraction level, with encouraging results. At the stage of hardware abstraction, adders (which are the most widely used and mandatory information operators in digital systems) have generated great interest in the approximation used in digital systems used in image processing applications. The approximate Brent-Kung adder (AxBK) is a variant of the simple Brent-Kung adder that introduces a degree of approximation into its operation. A new approximate BK adder is proposed with high-speed overall performance and low error cost. Its BK adder and AxBK adder are restricted to bits 8,16,32 using software called Xilinx Vivado and MATLAB.},

  abstract={Two principle concerns prompt some theorists to link quantum mechanics and theories of mind or theories of consciousness. On the one hand, it is commonly thought that conscious minds play some important role in processes of quantum measurement and that any good theory of mind ought to explain how a mind can play such a role. On the other hand, a few people think that the framework of classical physics is not, by itself, sufficiently powerful to explain the myriad remarkable properties of minds and that a good explanation must rely on some special features of quantum mechanics. Usually, these features include either state vector reduction-the collapse of the wave function-or special capabilities, often computational or super-computational ones, allegedly displayed by physical substrates while existing in hypothesised coherent states of linear superposition. Two questions summarise the author's misgivings about both the above motivations for linking quantum mechanics and theories of mind. First, does the process of quantum measurement really require a conscious observer? Second, does quantum mechanics underwrite any special effects in, say, intraneuronal protein lattices, which could play a role in instantiating consciousness in biological systems? It turns out that the particular character of the negative answer suggested for the first question also prompts a negative answer for the second. He summarises these negative answers after describing briefly some popular attempts to forge quantum theories of mind.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thought are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results. The results of this work show that it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.},

  title={Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.},

  abstract={This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  abstract={Using the Scratch environment as a tool to teach programming skills or develop computational thinking is increasingly common in all levels of education, well-documented case studies from primary school to university can be found. However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices. Along with suggestions for future work, some ideas that might assist to address such situations are proposed in the conclusions of the paper.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are valuable tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy, and to promote inclusion and integration of students. We currently have a multitude of robotic education tools at our disposal. These tools arise with the aim of promoting innovation and student motivation during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our society today. Therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our everyday life. This work is focused on presenting Raspberry Pi as enhancer of educational robotics. The first step is presenting robotics as a tool for promoting the inclusion and integration of students. For this work a background and overview is also provided. The third part proposed different setups to prepare a Raspberry Pi for remote activities and robotics using Arduino as hardware interface. The last but not the least is an open discussion with the aim of exchanging impressions and getting feedback from the attendees.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A multitude of educational robotics tools have emerged in recent years. Some with a high price and great features, and others with a lower price and lower performance. There are also cost-effective options that allow you to tailor your services to tighter budgets. The presence of robots in our daily lives is becoming more and more common. Therefore, it is interesting that we are oriented to integrate robots in the different levels of our society. This workshop is focused on driving the same content across three different low-cost robotic educational tools. The first one is Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programed. The second tool is Crumble, it is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language which eases its use by children aged below 14. The last but not the least is Arduino, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded into the board. This workshop is aimed to present the mentioned platforms as robotic educational tools for people as the first step to get into robotics world. Throughout this workshop an initiation to robotics is developed in the context of educational robotics.},

  abstract={The issue of transcribed digit acknowledgment has for some time been an open issue in the field of example order. A few examined have demonstrated that Neural Network has an incredible execution in information arrangement. The fundamental target of this paper is to give effective and solid procedures to acknowledgment of transcribed numerical by looking at different existing arrangement models. This paper thinks about the exhibition of Convolutional Neural Network (CCN). Results demonstrate that CNN classifier beat over Neural Network with critical improved computational effectiveness without relinquishing execution. Handwritten digit recognition can be performed using the Convolutional neural network from Machine Learning. Using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technologies) database and compiling with the CNN gives the basic structure of my project development. So, basically to perform the model we need some libraries such as NumPy, ‘Pandas’, TensorFlow, Keras. These are the main structure on which my main project stands. MNIST data contains about 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0–9. So, it is a class 10 classification model. This dataset is divided into 2 parts i.e. Training and Test dataset.

  abstract={Now-a-days information security over unsecured communication channel is one of the most challenging issues. Cryptography and steganography, a sub-discipline of information hiding, are two distinct popular security offering techniques. To get the combined chemistry from these techniques, today's real-time security systems include both cryptography and steganography in their working principle. To cope up with those systems, we have proposed a format-based pure text steganography algorithm including a private key cryptography providing a higher level of security. The cover text has been made as ordinary as possible. After successful embedding of the secret message into the cover text, the stego-text also looks like an ordinary text because only an alphanumeric puzzle is added at the end of the cover text to make up the stego-text. This final stego-text is sent to the receiver through the unsecured communication channel. Instead of correct recipient, if any third party or cracker or hacker obtains the stego-text, they may think that it is an ordinary text to teach English to the kids since we made it like that or if they try to extract the original message, it requires a huge amount of computational time. The proposed algorithm supersedes various text steganographic techniques through combining both cryptography and steganography.},

With virtual reality technologies gaining attention and popularity, our goal was to investigate and create a virtual workspace in which the students can find all the information and resources they need while learning spreadsheet programming, computer problem solving, and understanding, building algorithms. Following on this principle, we developed a 3D virtual collaboration space to provide students with one interface featuring the information and resources required to practice the Sprego method outside of and during classes. We have collected, refined, and structured the available sources and developed detailed tasks with explanations for students in the form of online documents. Our goal was to provide an all-in-one environment for the Sprego method to learn, explore, and practice all its aspects without leaving the 3D space. For our work, we examined different applications that provide virtual 3D spaces with educational support in mind. Our choice was the MaxWhere Seminar system, based on its innovative and effective approach in the field.},

  abstract={Data entry has been a hectic job since the era of data accumulation started. Apparently, that is why there is a full-fledged career in data entry. Data entry method varies with requirements. Early days of computers relied on punch cards and gradually keyboards and mouse came into picture which we still use. Touchscreens didn't take much time to replace the physical keyboard inputs and now as the result of human intelligence and innovation, the era of the optical input is here. Where the user does not even have to take the pain of thinking about entering data but can simply use an optical reader or scanner to input data. Using the computational power the individual elements like text, images, and special characters can be distinguished. OCR-Optical Character Recognizer does the work. OCR works similar to humans when it comes to character recognition as it maintains a database of characters and compares all the scanned elements with the database which makes it really simple to understand. This paper explains the working of an OCR in its different stages. That study helps in finding the various drawbacks of the conventional system. The paper also tells about how those shortcomings can be eliminated and how a better OCR that is future ready can be achieved.},

  abstract={Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that makes it easy for children above 10 to use. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.},

  abstract={Kohonen's self organizing maps (SOM) is a kind of neural network that the algorithm learns the feature of input data thorough unsupervised and competitive neighborhood learning. SOM is mapped from a high dimensional space onto a two dimensional space, so it can visualize the high-dimensional information to the map. In the SOM's learning algorithm, there are many factors to aggravate the computational load and a competition to be declared the winner. We think it is a major factor at the beginning of learning process that SOM's map is changing dynamically and widely and the learning dynamics depends on the distance of each input data. Thus we suppose that, by adjusting the data order, the competition must be reduced and the learning convergence must become faster. In this paper, we discuss the "efficient learning by data order adjustment", and compare it with the conventional method. We achieved a maximum 9% improvement.},

Some governmental agencies and national companies have to prepare to face AFTA and build their strategies to survive from trade area by understanding what Indonesian people think about that. In this paper we present a system to analyze the opinion of Indonesian people about AFTA and extract a useful information of the sentiment analysis from their opinion. Our system consists of 5 computational steps: (1) Data Acquisition, (2) Text Mining, (3) Sentiment Analysis Engine, (4) Temporal Projection Engine, and (5) Context Processing Unit. We apply a new approach to analyze opinions about AFTA by opinion mining based on temporal sentiment analysis. This approach extracts and process textual data automatically to obtain sentiment information in the opinion sentences. The results show effectiveness of the simple approach for gaining the sentiment information from people's opinions and some stakeholders and students who are concerned in AFTA have assessed this solution.},

The solver uses a nodal assembly technique where each node in the finite-element grid is mapped to a virtual processor in the computer. Using this solver, potential and current density distributions during transthoracic defibrillation have been calculated for different anatomic models, including a realistic 3-D finite-element model constructed from a series of cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of a mongrel dog. Numerical results obtained with this model are presented together with computational performance data for the algorithm.<>},

  abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract={In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.},

  abstract={We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.},

  abstract={In computer vision and increasingly, in rendering and image processing, it is useful to filter images with continuous rotated and scaled families of filters. For practical implementations, one can think of using a discrete family of filters, and then to interpolate from their outputs to produce the desired filtered version of the image. We propose a multirate implementation of deformable kernels, capable to further reduce the computational weight. The "basis" filters are applied to the different levels of a pyramidal decomposition. The new system is not shift-invariant-it suffers from "aliasing". We introduce a new quadratic error criterion which keeps into account the inherent system aliasing. By using hypermatrix and Kronecker algebra, we are able to cast the global optimization task into a multilinear problem. An iterative procedure ("pseudo-SVD") is used to minimize the overall quadratic approximation error.},

The goal of the program is to advance both knowledge and practice in creating inclusive, responsive computer science/computational thinking programs for all K-12 youth. RPPs represent an approach to research that, by design, is both more equitable and more ethical because it leverages community stakeholder experiences and perspectives to inform research questions, methods, and meaning-making. RPPs are thus potentially powerful tools for equity-oriented initiatives such as CS for All. Beginning in December 2016, the Research + Practice Collaboratory, an NSF-funded initiative based at the University of Washington, has led ten RPP development workshops for CS for All, collectively serving over 700 members of the community. At these workshops we have collected data about how the community sees itself benefiting from the adoption of RPP approaches to the work. In this experience paper we describe what we have learned about the field's interests with respect to adopting RPP approaches to the work.},

Second order linear system sliding curves eliminate the reaching phase and consequently and associated problems of load sensitivity and high demanded torque. Moreover, the chattering usually present in the sliding phase also disappears with the new control law. Simulation results show a negligible coupling between axes, thus enabling an easier and more efficient controller adjustment. It is also shown that the controller parameter set can be easily adjusted, and there is a large set of possible quasi-optimal values. This is of utmost importance, when one thinks of the industrial applications of this type of algorithms. Experiments were developed based on the position control problem. Nevertheless, generalization to the trajectory tracking problem is trivial. In either case the controller computational requirements are low, thus well adapted to today's microprocessor based digital control technology.<>},

The "Computing" course is a ten-week course that includes material on the following: the "computing perspective" (the algorithmic model as a way of thinking); foundational concepts underlying program design and implementation, including: algorithmic methods, static and dynamic data structures, and design using abstraction; fundamental notions of algorithm analysis and computability; and use of application tools such as e-mail, Web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, databases, and equation solvers. Building on this foundational pre-programming material, students in the "Programming" course are able to learn rapidly the skills in program design, implementation, and debugging necessary to solve computational problems in a high-level programming language. We emphasize effective use of abstraction and the acquisition of software development skills that are language independent. Our experience with these courses has convinced us that it is possible to introduce the conceptual foundations of computer science to beginning students in a way that both engages them and gives them a basis for learning advanced ways to solve problems using computing, either via programming or through use of modern, highly-programmable commercial applications.},

  abstract={Automatic extraction of opinions on products from Web has been receiving interest increasingly. Such extracted knowledge helps to find out what other people think about the particular product or service. With the growing availability of resources like online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden growth in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational techniques for opinion extraction and understanding created an utmost need to understand and view the Web in a different prospect. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion-mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.},

  abstract={The results obtained by the elementary school students in subjects like math and Portuguese mother language have been worrisome during the last few years. There are several reasons for this, but opinions point to the student's inability to solve problems, difficulties in logical reasoning and lack of critical attitude. The Portuguese Ministry of Education proposed in 2015/2016, in extracurricular period, the Getting Started with Programming challenging in primary School activities, with the intention of promoting computational thinking competences in students. Two schools from Coimbra city opted to use Scratch software for the implementation of this project aiming to promote school success in subjects already mentioned. The project, based on the academic curriculum of 4th grade, intends to link the theoretical knowledge with the practical knowledge, promoting the characteristic values of the city of Coimbra. This project implementation resulted in different applications (computer games) created by students, covering the contents of the mentioned subjects, but concretizing these knowledge with the socio-cultural and environmental realities of the city of Coimbra. The following study demonstrates the results obtained in 5 classes in 2015-2016 and six classes in 2016-2017, according to student satisfaction and project evaluation.},

  abstract={Given a capable human being and a computer, it is possible to make an approximation to the solution of a nonlinear differential equation. However, under the (usually correct) assumption that the equation is analytically intractable, the result of the computation is not the exact solution; indeed it may be so far from the exact solution as to be completely useless. We are interested in the relationship between the effort expended by the human and the computer, and the duality of the computed approximation to a partial or ordinary differential equation. To be specific, we would like to think in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. The cost of the computation is a combination of the human effort and computer resources used to obtain the approximation. The benefit includes, of course, the computed approximation, but it also includes an estimate of the quality of the approximation, that is, an error estimate. It is our opinion that in computational science, as with the experimental sciences, results should always be presented with some estimate of their accuracy. In addition, however, there is another facet to error estimation: one cannot even attempt a cost-benefit analysis or efficiency comparison of methods without an error estimate to evaluate the results.},

  abstract={One of the grand challenges of the future generation intelligent systems is how to build a robot which can think in a way similar to human beings. In this case, cognitive robotics attempts to embed cognitive abilities of the natural intelligence, specially the human brain, in robotics applications. To provide the context of such an objective, an interdisciplinary approach which is a merger of different fields of study like artificial intelligence, cognitive informatics, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience, should be adopted. In this paper, to design the behavioral mechanism of adventurous robots, the Motivation/Attitude-Driven Behavior (MADB) model, which is a plausible computational model of human behavior with the purpose of simulating robots equipped with basic humanoid emotions, is exploited. As a result, the proposed model has provided adventurous robots with the capability of showing emotional behaviors. Finally, adventurous robots and conventional ones are separately implemented in a virtual ecosystem and their effort for survival is compared. Consequently, the simulation results show that adventurous robots have a greater chance to survive in the simulated environment.},

From a research standpoint, data processing needs have increasingly become common in an ever growing number of applications, with potential benefits not only in our work but also in our lives: the need not just to acquire, store and perform modest operational tasks but also to analyze and properly interpret data. In this talk, we consider some of the hottest and most demanding scenarios in our daily lives, which include: medical analytics to improve the quality of life of the elderly and reduce health care expenses; social network analytics for enhancing cultural heritage dissemination; exploration of work datafication potential in improving the management of human resources (HRM); game analytics to foster Computational Thinking in education. We describe the recent findings we have obtained in our research in these contexts using the latest technology for data analytics, including interpretable machine learning, and discuss the consequences and directions for the future.},

In order to try to reverse this scenario, several countries are working on a way to include computer science concepts, like computational thinking, in their curriculums for K-12 education. In addition, many studies and researches are being done related to practices and tools that can be applied in order to retain students that applied for computer science courses. In order to contribute to these initiatives, this paper presents CODEX, an interactive and ludic learning object, that aims to help students that do not need to have a background in programming to learn one of the most important structure in a programming language, the loop. CODEX was designed to be used both in class and in extra-class activity.},

  pages={220-227 vol.1},
  abstract={Multi-agent system is one of the most popular research interests in robotics nowadays. How would collections of simple robots aid us in human endeavours? Let us think about an ant colony. Ants have little capability, but when many of them are working together, they can do incredible tasks. By examining the major control architectures available in robotics area, decentralized-based reactive control architecture gives the tools required. Priority-based scheme is used in arbitration level to select which behaviour to run. It does not need to gather all information from various sensors to plan its action like deliberative control, which is also known as sensors fusion that clearly required a lot of computational time. Besides that, the mapping that the deliberate control architecture produces might not be valid at the time when changes occur between the time it gathers the information and the time it plans its actions. Instead, intelligence will arise when these simple agents work together to perform some complex task cooperatively. Our multi-agent system consists of three mobile robots that are required to transfer a large object through a restricted area. We are using a leader follower strategy to accomplish this task. Intelligence in multi-agent system in our context is that any agents have a possibility to be a leader or a follower depending on current situation of the environment. This means that all agents are homogeneously equal in hardware and software. By having this capability, it will ensure the burden of the programming task will be decreased because there will be only one program needed for the whole system. In this paper, decentralized reactive control architecture is used to develop an intelligent multi-agent cooperative strategy to perform complex task like carrying a load and navigation.},

This paper proposed a modification to the connectivity matrix algorithm (MCMA) to consider n-1 criteria. The modified algorithm is valid to get the optimal PMU placement thinking of any level of redundancy in the measurements at any location. The modified algorithm is validated by considering zero injection bus (ZIB) and without for the double redundancy condition. The algorithm applies to different size test systems: IEEE-14 bus, IEEE-30 bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE-118 bus. The computational time of the MCMA is less than 10% of the fastest algorithm in the literature.},

  abstract={In 1999 I had the honor of presenting a Keynote talk entitled "Databases Unplugged: Challenges in Ubiquitous Data Management" at the inaugural MDM conference in Hong Kong. In that talk I spoke about the anticipated ubiquity of mobile devices and mobile applications and predicted some of the data management research challenges that could be foreseen from this sea change in the computational landscape. My views at the time were in sync with the influential Asilomar Report on Database Research [1], published in 1998, to which I contributed. The Asilomar report featured mobile devices as a "major driver" for the data management research agenda and predicted that "In ten years, billions of people will be using the Web, but a trillion "gizmos" will also be connected to the Web." Despite this optimism, The research agenda I described in my MDM talk [2] was driven in many ways by what I saw as the expected limitations of the mobile environment. Among these were: intermittent connectivity, poor battery life, and low-function user interfaces. Thus, my expectation was that technologies such as synchronization and conflict resolution, broadcast-based data dissemination, micro-kernel database systems and context-aware prefetching were technologies that would play a central role in making such devices usable as data management platforms. Rolling the clock forward twelve years, it appears that the Asilomar prediction of the number of connected devices was overly optimistic by about 3 orders of magnitude, and the technical limitations I was concerned about were substantially mitigated by tremendous innovation in mobile devices and mobile user interfaces as well as massive global investment in wireless infrastructure. On the other hand, we were both right about the huge impact of mobile computing on the way people acquire, interact with, and share information, and the fact that the ubiquity of such devices would have profound implications for data management. Undeterred by the paper trail outlined above, in this talk I plan to survey the state of the mobile data management field as it stands twelve years later. I'll review progress in areas such as sensor networks, integration with cloud computing, and location-based services. I'll also discuss what I see as a fundamental game changer brought about by mobile technology the closer integration of people into the entire data management lifecycle [3]. Social computing, crowd sourcing, and hyper-personalization are examples of ways in which the personalized nature of mobile devices is changing the way that we interact with information. I'll argue that such human-centric concerns will cause a rethinking of systems architectures and their components, and will require new ways of thinking about query processing, data quality and data-intensive applications. And if I get to do this again in 2023, we'll see how that turns out.},
