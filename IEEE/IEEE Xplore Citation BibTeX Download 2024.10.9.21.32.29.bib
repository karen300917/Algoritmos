  abstract={Image classification is a popular and important area of image processing research in today's society. For machine learning, SVM is a very good classification model. CNN is a type of convolution neural network that has an unpredictable development and uses convolution calculations. It is one of the most well-known deep learning algorithms. This review thinks about and inspects exemplary AI and profound learning picture classification procedures involving SVM and CNN as specific illustrations. Using a large sample mnist dataset, this study found that CNN has an accuracy of 0.97 and SVM has an accuracy of 0.89; SVM has an accuracy of 0.85 and CNN has an accuracy of 0.82 when working with a small sample ImageNet dataset. Tests in this review show that for little example informational collections, standard ML has an improved arrangement impact than deep learning structure does.},

  abstract={Granular information processing is one of the human-inspired problem-solving aspects of natural computing, as information abstraction is inherent in human thinking and reasoning processes, and plays an essential role in human cognition. Among the different facets of natural computing fuzzy sets, rough sets and their hybridization are well accepted paradigms that are based on the construction, representation and interpretation of granules, as well as the utilization of granules for problem solving. These tools are also known as primary constituents of soft computing whose objective is to provide flexible information processing capability for handling real-life ambiguous situations. They have been successfully employed in various image processing tasks, including image segmentation, enhancement and classification, both individually or in combination with other computing techniques. The reason of such success is rooted to the fact that they provide powerful tools to describe uncertainty, naturally embedded in images, which can be exploited in various image processing tasks.},

  abstract={System planners, architects, and developers often make the same mistakes on grand scales, but we usually stay with familiar approaches, especially under deadline pressures. Engineers and managers embrace the concept of process improvement, yet they rarely take time (or have the privilege of taking the time) to consider how something that has worked in the past could be improved. It is equally rare for them to make the effort to change plans and processes to benefit from mistakes. This article explores several high-level lessons learned, mostly on large system developments that were not always successful. The lessons concern project difficulties caused by thinking that's stuck in the present; excessive faith in code reuse; failure to see the big picture; absence of independent failure analysis; and estimation processes driven by fear and ignorance.},

The Timed I/O Automata (TIOA) modeling framework has been used for describing and analyzing many distributed algorithms, ranging from data-management algorithms to clock-synchronization algorithms to robot-coordination algorithms. These algorithms include timing aspects, and both discrete and continuous behavior. In this talk, I will describe the TIOA framework in some detail, and summarize many of the examples to which it has been applied. Then, I will discuss the extensions that are needed to enable it to handle more kinds of algorithms. These extensions will mainly involve adding and integrating features for handling probabilistic choices. I will review the state of the art for Probabilistic Timed I/O Automata models, and describe the work that I think is still needed.},

However, the value priority of a person may change over time due to different factors such as time, event, influence, social structure, and technology. In this research, we are the first to investigate whether the change of value priorities can be identified from social network usage.

During the conception step, one "sees" the needs for a specific IC in the market and "thinks" of how to realize it in terms of the available technologies. This step thus usually ends up with the function definition of the IC in question and the choice of the center technology for its realization. In the design step, one "plans" how to build the IC to fulfill the desired specifications. The last step is reserved for "doing" the fabrication and the testing to ensure the satisfaction of all requirements.},

  abstract={There exist a lot of incremental innovations to solve superficial problems. Breakthrough type innovation, however, is expected to solve latent problems. Consequently it realizes safe and wealthy society and competitive economy. Incremental innovation is realized by summation of several solutions in a conventional fixed dimension. The authors think that breakthrough type innovation is realized by expanding this dimension to missing dimension. A bladeless electric fan, a smart-phone, the cloud computing are the examples that new business model was born in a different dimension from conventional one. The authors propose a method to create this new dimension by the chemical model of catalytic effect. As an example; the innovation caused by smart meter is described. It is simply replacement by of an analog meter to digital within telecommunication in a fixed dimension to realized AMR (Automated Meter Reading). However, smart grid is applied as catalyst, smart meter get the opportunity of AMI. This creates breakthrough type innovation in electric power industry.

On this basis, an information processing model based on BP neural network (BPNN) and statistical method is discussed, and the principle of BPNN is explained in detail. After analyzing these phenomena, researchers think that natural language processing is more suitable for tasks requiring accurate results, and the understanding level of natural language processing is divided into seven levels from low level to high level: pronunciation level → morphology level → vocabulary level → syntax level → semantics level → pragmatics level → context level.

The BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) specification is adopted to establish order process model. The model can be used to describe the company's core business and the order information transmission process with the process-oriented thinking. Then Web standard-JSF (Java Server Faces) is introduced to develop the system. The operation results show that order information can be transferred timely, fast, accurately, which avoids the delays or inaccuracies caused by manual operation. Meanwhile the managers can follow the tracks of the order progress at all times and provide clients with advice. The process-based order management system improved the information management ability of the printing enterprise and laid foundation for the realization of informatization enterprise-wide.},

  abstract={In a number of tasks for assessing natural and medical prints, deep neural networks have bettered humans. These achievements, however, are solely reliant on properly labelled training data. When presented with a few samples of noisy-labelled images, the network training strategy might encounter difficulties, resulting in a suboptimal classification models. The quality of medical picture annotations strongly depends on the knowledge and experience of the annotators, which makes this difficulty more acute in the context of medical image analysis. Such problem arises due to a number of reasons ranging from human error, inexperience or even misreading of the images. But at the same time, proper labels are exceptionally useful in training models, while improperly labelled data actually hampers the efficiency of the model. Label for a lot of the image dataset out there is actually already generated, but when we think about the noisy labelled data and go for an unsupervised learning model instead of a supervised model the labels that are correct are also going to waste. To solve this problem without wasting labels, a sparsely supervised learning strategy based on transfer learning is constructed with the aid of the keras Xception model. This paper compares the efficiency of a sparsely supervised learning model employing transfer learning to that of other traditional CNN models based on their performance metrics.},

Despite changes in learning models, education providers certainly want to maintain academic quality by producing graduates with superior academics, practical knowledge, and innovative thinking. The problem currently faced is how education providers can monitor students' performance to complete their studies correctly. Therefore, a grade prediction is needed that helps students, lecturers, and administrators of educational institutions maintain and improve academic quality. This study compares the techniques.

How to ensure data security has aroused people's thinking. In order to ensure the communication security of network data, this paper points out the security threats in computer network communication, clarifies the significance of data encryption technology, and analyzes the commonly used data encryption methods in computer network communication. In this paper, a computer data security application model based on edge computing is constructed. In this model, data redundancy elimination method and differential privacy protection algorithm are adopted successively. After removing duplicate data and obtaining good quality data, the computer data is privacy protected, and the data security processing based on edge computing is realized. After testing, the privacy protection budget value of the built model is 0.23, and the computer data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is the smallest. Under this condition, the maximum data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is reduced from 0.678 to 0.234, and the data security is significantly improved.},

  abstract={Epilepsy is considered as one of the most dangerous and fatal neurological disorder for the patient suffering from it. It affects the particular areas of the brain, due to which patient has seizures. Epilepsy is often referred to as ‘mirgi’ in the Hindi language. The purpose of the paper is to identify and understand the prediction of the seizures that occur due to neurological disorder called Epilepsy. Epilepsy can be explained as the disorder of central nervous system, which results in abnormal activities inside the brain. The impacts of this disorder come out as seizures, and patient behaves in a weird manner. Sometimes the patient can even lose the track of consciousness and sensations, the power of thinking and reacting is also affected. When seen during Electroencephalogram, the brain wave patterns which are observed appear to be different and abnormal. It is one of the difficult diseases to be diagnosed. In this project, we have tried to find out the result as whether the patient is having an epileptic seizure or not, using machine learning models, like KNN, logistic regression and naïve bayes. The Output label column of the dataset has the value whether patient is having (1) or not having (0) a seizure. In this paper, we have preprocessed the dataset and calculated the accuracies of the models on both training and testing datasets. Dataset is extracted from GitHub and the coding is performed in python programming language. Python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpyetc are used in the pre-processing of the model. We have later on come to the result as out of the three models that we have used which one gives the best results, with the help of AUC value.},

  abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising technology that controls computers or machines using brain signals. With this technology, people with various disabilities, such as neural paralysis, and spinal cord injury can control electric devices or express their intention by thinking. However, previous BCI studies have a limitation that they can predict only one type of intention. To use the BCI system in daily life, the BCI user should be able to achieve various tasks such as moving, text typing, and arm movements. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional BCI method that can predict various intentions simultaneously. To classify multiple intentions, we proposed two prediction models using Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. To evaluate the proposed BCI system, the classification accuracy of the model was measured and compared using steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), sensory motor rhythm (SMR), and both of them (Multiple Intention). The average prediction accuracies were 22.46% in NN, 55.86% in CNN. These results indicate that the proposed multi-functional BCI can predict multiple intentions. It also means that users of the proposed BCI system can control various electric devices simultaneously.},

  abstract={We present a new conception of process service which is the extension of workflow. The separation of process logic from business logic is the key for building such service in system layer. However, the separation idea is often hard to be implemented because of inherent coupling characteristics in business process applications. None of workflow systems, including flexible workflow systems, is very successful in that aspect. We have analyzed WFMC model and find that there exist several defects in it. The model lacks necessary criterion and some of the elements are so inexplicit that they're implemented excessively randomly in workflow systems. We think that it's the root of the separation problem. We design a new model for process service. Compared with WFMC model, both the composition and the structure are changed. Especially, we constitute a framework on the model to realize the separation idea really and truly.},

  abstract={Objective: To test the effect of the artificial intelligence video feedback system in the basketball shooting teaching in Colleges and universities. Methods: 24 male basketball players from XX University were randomly divided into experimental group (n=12) and control group (n=12). The experimental group and the control group were given shooting learning for 8 weeks. During each teaching period, the experimental group was intervened with 10-minute video feedback system, while the control group was not intervened. Results: After the experiment, the shooting percentage and the performance of action skill evaluation of the experimental group were significantly higher than those before the experiment (p=0. 032<0.05). After the experiment, the control group in the fixed-point shot and jump shot shooting percentage and action skill evaluation results were higher than before the experiment (p=0.158>0.05). After the experiment, the experimental group in the fixed-point shot and jump shot shooting percentage and action skill evaluation results were significantly higher than the control group (p=0. 026<0.05). Conclusion: The application of artificial intelligence video feedback system in college basketball shooting teaching is helpful to: Students can get the action points of shooting technique more richly and intuitively; Help students quickly establish the technical action model and spatial thinking concept of shooting; The correction and consolidation of shooting techniques are more personalized and timely.},

  abstract={The computation of relative Saliency in fused approximate images' local area is the key of obtaining efficient image fusion coefficients. According to the statistical characteristic of wavelet approximate coefficients in fused image, wavelet Generalized Gamma Distribution(G Γ D) model is built for capturing the distribution of approximate coefficients in local area. GΓD model's parameters are estimated by Immune Clone Selection(ICS) algorithm derived from Evolutionary Computation thinking. The estimated parameters are applied in a new fusion strategy for obtaining the final fusion coefficients. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new approach when compared to the methods such as traditional contrast pyramid(CP) and wavelet fusion methods in terms of image information entropy(IE) values, average gradient(AG) values and standard difference(STD) values.},

  abstract={Transhipment is the process of moving goods from source to destination passing through several intermediate checkpoints. Tracking of a transhipment involves few issues that need to be addressed, like goods being a) damaged, b) lost c) delayed in delivery, d) delivered to wrong recipient, etc. All these issues are the major cause of dissatisfaction to the customers if no proper tracking system is available. In this case, Cognitive Agents (CAs) can be found helpful as they are capable of thinking and acting accordingly as a human brain. In this paper using CAs with Behaviour-Observation-Belief (BOB) model, the tracking of transhipment of goods is done. Its performance is good with respect to accuracy, successful transhipment rate and bandwidth consumption.},

  abstract={A microformat is a set of design principles for including semantic information within standard X/HTML markup. Individual microformat entities are distributed yet share a common semantics. Each microformat is a granule of structured information containing a set of attributes. These information granules can be produced, distributed, aggregated, and consumed without reliance on centralized services. We describe the impact on the gathering, distribution, and analysis of concepts within our visual communication research. In this paper we present solutions for managing lexical consistency when microformat-structured information granules are distributed and maintained independently and asynchronously. Lexical groups and hierarchies leverage the resulting inconsistencies, utilizing term aggregation across visual and linguistic features to dynamically compose lexicons and to perform lexical analysis. We think of this as creating semantic and orthographic 'projections' of the lexicon into different feature spaces. We show how to use this approach to construct situated lexicons which derive from shared context and social communities.},

  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing(CC), the three service levels of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and the cloud service delivery model of “cloud” + “end” have changed the development thinking of the entire IT industry. The education industry has also been influenced by new technologies and concepts, especially the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distribution”, which make the education industry face the challenges in teaching and learning resources management and laboratory management. In particular, the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distributed” - have given the education industry a revolutionary solution to the challenges faced in the management of teaching resources and laboratory management. In this paper, we design a simulation model of physical education(PE) teaching in CC based on Java. The results show that the Java-based CC PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for course learning; and being able to continuously improve students' performance. The results show that the Java-based cloud-based PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for the learning of the course; and continuously stimulating students' learning initiatives to achieve the purpose of improving academic interest indicators.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which is neurological and developmental condition. ASD can be detected by observing distinct patterns in an individual's learning, behaviour, communication, decision making ability and social interactions. The ability to anticipate emotions can prove beneficial in various situations, particularly when dealing with individuals across the autism spectrum with varying degrees of severity. Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading. Similar methods are used now to assist those who are autistic. There is also discussion of medical applications using minimal parameters and methods.},

Modeling the brain, an initiative already begun, is going to become very important. There are major benefits to the health field in understanding how the brain works, which might lead to the cures of many currently difficult or impossible to cure diseases. A brain simulator can allow experiments which are unethical and impossible on humans.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of word alignment by combining IBM 5-models, Word Entropy model and Support Information model organically[1]. The sub-models of the Support Information model includes: Minimum Intersection model and Minimum Difference model. Researches indicate that IBM model could implement word alignment with high recall value but low precision result, while the Support Information model can bring low recall value but high precision result and the Word Entropy model could effectively reduce the affected noises from other words. So we think up an idea that combining and utilizing the advantages of these models. Experimental result of our hybrid model obtains 89.19% of the f-measure, 88.74% of the recall and 89.66% of the precision.},

In this article, we will try to reflect on the positioning of the subject before digital technology and on how we can think about the real at this moment in history. In practical terms, the real has imposed itself in the last three years in which the pandemic by COVID-19 made us rethink the bases of our existence. Its relationship with image expressions, like indexicality, mimicry or visibility, seems obvious. However, the complexity of the image brought by digital technologies that capture, edit and/or construct in a participative way in realtime, implies that expressions like illusion, participation, simulation or creativity; become much more pertinent to the discussion of the image and the positioning of the subject. By dislocating/displacing reality, /replacing it, through the manipulative capacity offered by the technology that is essentially plasma through computer graphics and exponentiated in portable devices, the image lost one of the fundamental characteristics of its essence as testimony, gaining an interactive synaesthetic dimension and enhancing the creativity of the users/fruiters.},

Exploring the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the place the user needs to travel thereby facilitating user perception on travel is becoming a mandate nowadays. Travel perception is also important for variety of day-to-day activities like transportation of goods and services, health related travel etc., This work aims to create comprehensive and efficient prediction models, facilitated by a convenient user interface to predict how risky or convenient it is for a user to travel in a time where COVID-19 is prevalent. The predictions made are based on the location they wish to travel using various Machine Learning models. The results are combined with the individual's health history to arrive at an optimized decision. The model is trained using a comorbidities dataset as well as a location- wise weather dataset, which allows us to make the prediction of whether travelling is dangerous for the user or not. The user interface is designed to show predictions for various districts. The trained model is tested using the data provided in social media and government websites provided for prediction},

  abstract={under the background of economic globalization and financial integration, the financial market has gradually become an important part of the current market system. Besides the stock market is an important part of the financial market. From a macro perspective, government regulatory departments and policy makers can monitor the stock market by using stock index prediction model, so as to adjust macroeconomic policies in time. From a micro perspective, individual investors and enterprise investors can use stock index prediction model to improve their ability of avoiding risks, so it is of practical significance to build a high-precision stock index prediction model. In this paper, the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) method and SVR (Support Vector Regression) algorithm were combined to construct the EMD-SVR stock index prediction model, and the IEME (Improved Extreme Mirror Extension) method was proposed to suppress the end effect of EMD method to form the IEME-EMD-SVR model. Finally, through the empirical research on the transaction price data of Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index and the comparative study on EMD-SVR model and IEME-EMD-SVR model, it is proved that IEME-EMD-SVR model has higher prediction accuracy and lower time complexity. The proposed model has provided a powerful tool for stock index prediction and provided a new way of thinking for the application of time-frequency analysis in financial time series.},

A construal is a software artefact that embodies how we think about something, or make sense of something.

We shall show a construal of MENACE : an early example of a simple machine (made with matchboxes) that learns to improve its own performance at playing noughts and crosses. Some experts in machine learning contrast the `big data' methods of training networks with the use of explanatory models. It is proving difficult, but desirable, to integrate these approaches. We'll suggest why Empirical Modelling might offer some useful insights into this problem.},

To keep the rise of house price within a proper range and acceptable to the public, the government has adopted various approaches to bring the price under control. After intermittent fluctuations, house purchasing has become a hot topic for both the media and the public. It is of great significance to study the change of house price considering all the related factors. Some scientists prefer machine learning. Machine learning is a subject which involves many subjects such as probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, and algorithm complexity theory. In this paper, we will discuss the details of the machine learning algorithms, three typical models (i.e., AdaBoost, Linear Regression and KNN) and their strengths and weaknesses. In the future, the growing complexity of all the factors that influence house price will cause more and more trouble for scientists pursuing more precise results. Also, based on its own specialty that computer is still not able to think like a man, machine learning cannot achieve 100% right, which often results in some silly outcomes.},

In the implementation of the scrum framework, we often encounter obstacles and challenges in the field, one of them is a sense of belonging to the team’s work itself. The scrum team should act on their own and already know what to do on each sprint. They are already committed to what they think can be accomplished and can be helped by feeling ownership of the work they do each sprint. If the Scrum team is committed to the work to be carried out, over time it will certainly foster a sense of ownership within the Scrum team itself, including satisfaction with the results they have achieved. The most important thing to a Scrum Team is to remember, that the team is to take ownership of themselves. They are responsible for their own accountability, If they are to be truly self-directed. A lot of research has been done to determine the maturity level of a scrum team with their respective methods such as the Scrum Maturity Model and Agile Maturity Model but not related to team ownership.},

  abstract={Fracturing sand control is a complex sand prevention method. There are so many influence factors which can not be modeled by the structuring models in both the decision and the operation process. Expert system for the optimization design of the fracturing sand control can simulate the thinking patterns of those experts, collect the computer knowledge and models in the field, apply the fuzzy mathematics to the project design, deal with the uncertain parameters using fuzzy set theory, and qualify such parameters to achieve analogy reasoning. Thus, an intelligent analysis system is established, which can carry out analogy analysis and decision making based on the cases in engineering database and experiences in knowledge base, modify the parameters related to fracturing sand control by comparing different operation parameters and analogy reasoning, select the reasonable operation parameters, provide the feasible operation project, perform evaluation on the project and forecast the final result. Such a system can eliminate the hidden troubles during the operation, improve the scientific value of the operation and ensure the operation quality.},

  abstract={The existing neural networks mainly involve working memory in the memory module, which can basically meet the needs of a neural network at work. However, for human intelligence, working memory is far from meeting the needs, especially in some advanced activities, such as thinking, language and emotion. Based on the concept driven processing theory, that is, the top-down processing mode of human perception, and the dualprocess theory of attention, that is, automatic processing and control processing based on the cognitive resource theory, this paper puts forward the computer neural network long-term memory storage model and the computer neural network dualprocess model, in order to construct the long-term memory of computer neural network, reduce the loss of computing time and computing resources, and improve the processing rate of information. It provides the possibility for the realization of neural network in automatic processing, subconscious judgment and other activities, as well as high-level activities such as self-control, strategy formulation and organization planning.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={When it comes to scene classification, the lack of labelled data is a significant obstacle that forces researchers to think about innovative solutions. This work presents a revolutionary method to strengthen scene classification models by combining transfer learning with AI-generated images. A key component of this project is the construction of a carefully curated dataset of 3672 augmented AI-generated photos in a total of 6 scenes. This database not only serves as a helpful resource for additional research but also makes a substantial contribution to this area of research. Using this dataset, a VGG16 model is trained, demonstrating the usefulness of synthetic data with a notable increase in accuracy. The model's performance is further improved through subsequent training using realistic photos through transfer learning, thereby surpassing the initial baseline. This work demonstrates the transformative effect of transfer learning on scene categorization accuracy and verifies its effectiveness using synthetic data through rigorous testing and evaluation. The results open the door for AI-generated photos to be used as an effective approach to address data scarcity issues in scene classification, which will help real-world applications improve.},

  abstract={Floods cause havoc in many regions of India every year during the monsoon season. However, commuters really do not really think of the after effects caused by the floods. Commuting during water-logging is risky because the depth of logged water cannot be determined. This can lead to cars and bikes getting stuck inside the flooded zone. Thus travelling through such areas can lead to loss of life. Our paper focuses on the classification of floodwater depth. We propose a deep-learning model that classifies the depth of the flood water level into different categories according to the depth. In this paper, we have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images given as an input by the user/commuter. For better user accessibility we propose to integrate the model with a cross-platform app that would be convenient for the commuters; along with an in-app alert system, which notifies other users about the location where the water level is above threshold value.},

  abstract={Machine learning models have achieved significant milestones in various domains, for example, computer vision models have an exceptional result in object recognition, and in natural language processing, where Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT can start a conversation with human-like proficiency. However, abstract reasoning remains a challenge for these models, “Can AI really thinking like a human?” still be a question yet to be answered. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a metric designed to assess human reasoning capabilities. It presents a series of eight images as a problem set, where the participant should try to discover the underlying rules among these images and select the most appropriate image from eight possible options that best completes the sequence. This task always be used to test human reasoning abilities and IQ. Zhang et al proposed a dataset called RAVEN [12] which can be used to test Machine Learning model abstract reasoning ability. In this paper, we purposed Vision Transformer Contrastive Network which build on previous work with the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPiNet), which set a new benchmark for permutation-invariant models Raven's Progressive Matrices by incorporating “contrast effects” from psychology, cognition, and education, and extends this foundation by leveraging the cutting-edge Vision Transformer architecture. This integration aims to further refine the machine's ability to process and reason about spatial-temporal information from pixel-level inputs and global wise features on RAVEN dataset.},

  pages={790-795},
  abstract={Corrosion of the welded joint has been singled out as a main cause of damage to ships. Insufficient maintenance of ships causes severe accidents due to the deterioration of products. These accidents lead to serious problems ranging from environmental pollution caused by oil spills to loss of lives. In order to prevent such accidents, we should design the product's life cycle before designing the product, evaluate the life of the product, and make effective maintenance plans by computer simulation. Additionally, we should think of realizing the best product design front the viewpoint of life-cycle management. This paper presents a welded joint model that considers the effect of corrosion of the welded joint of a ship structure and presents a scenario for the collapse of a ship. In addition, a simulation method for evaluating product deterioration by corrosion of the welded joint is shown. In order to support a life-cycle design that takes corrosion into account, the authors have implemented a life-cycle simulation system based on a product model for computer-aided design and production.},

The didactic proposal aims to develop solving skills for pencil and paper problems, for assembling and measuring circuits with real components, for reverse engineer of assembled circuit and allows the incorporation of some design elements. The experiences are presented on a basic technology class of first year of engineer career, in which different configuration of black boxes with four accessible test points are used as two-pole network. Student interest is observed in class as they get actively involved in learning of circuits. Thus development possibilities of thinking skills get opened, such as analyzing, predicting, evaluating, among others. From perception, the Incorporation of experiential knowledge is facilitated. This open the way to a theoretical knowledge with a higher degree of abstraction. Once the student has measured, interpreted, proposed alternative models, and has contrasted models with specific configuration, he will have some conceptual tools to address more complex systems.},

Under the background of increasing international competition, the update speed of high-tech is changing with each passing day. With the wide application of VR technology by modern people, the 3D animation industry has been further developed. The effective combination of 3D animation scene graphic design and VR technology can further improve the overall perfection of 3D animation scene design. This paper improves the lighting model and shadow rendering algorithm according to the defects of the general lighting rendering algorithm in the application of 3D animation scenes. Based on this, a hybrid 3D scene lighting rendering algorithm is obtained. When optimizing the Cook Torrance lighting model, a geometric attenuation factor algorithm is used, and when improving the shadow rendering algorithm, a light shadow rendering algorithm based on variance shadow is used.},

ALE extend well-developed theories of educational practice into the domain of interactive computer-assisted instruction. The resulting computer-supported environments facilitate sustained learning by active learners. A major goal of the ALE architecture is to help students understand the kinds of problems and opportunities that exist in complex, real world environments. A related goal is to help students integrate their knowledge through the repeated exploration of the same situation (macrocontext) from multiple points of view. This paper discusses a series of relates ALE spanning the disciplines of mathematics, physics, history, and geography. The research described provides a blueprint for an interactive teaching program that bridges multiple departments, introducing students, educators, and faculty to the possibilities of technology-supported integrated curricula learning.},

  abstract={There are more and more electromagnetic compatibility problems contributing to safety related errors, malfunctions and other failures in Chinese High Speed Railway. However, the classical EMC test and theory does not take into account risk analysis of EMC especially in safety critical systems. In order to help engineers to solve the EMC problems systematically, a method with risk assessment and management thinking is used in this paper. First the study proposes an EMC Risk Analysis Model (EMCRAM) based on the Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM) with four levels. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is introduced to calculate the risk of EMC faults when the risk value of the indices is obtained with the method of EMC measurement and experts' knowledge and experience. To demonstrate the approach, it is validated by an application of railway signal system and the results show the EMC risk and vulnerability in the railway signal system.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper affords a hybrid forecasting scheme for time series prediction in head-primarily based aggregation clusters. The proposed version combines multiple individual predictors in a manner that permits each to capture heterogeneous characteristics of the time series and think of each of the temporal and spatial dimensions within the enter statistics. An aggregation step is also included to construct cluster distributions to enhance prediction accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated on actual datasets with recognition of each temporal and spatial dimension. Results display the effectiveness of the proposed technique in predicting destiny values of time collection with accuracy higher than individual predictions. Further, the model also can cope with minor adjustments within the shape of facts, allowing for excessive flexibility within the analysis and forecasting procedure. It explores the ability of hybrid predictions of time collection in head-based total aggregation clusters. It provides a complete time collection evaluation, forecasting the usage of an aggregate of records mining and device-getting-to-know techniques. The paper introduces the vital standards and techniques for an adequate time series forecasting version. A hybrid prediction model consisting of the Autoregressive included shifting standard (ARIMA) model and the Weighted Neighbourhood common (WNA) model is then explored. The efficacy of the version is statistically tested on an artificial dataset with constant natural and seasonal time series additives and on one actual-global dataset with a vast range of correlated time collection. Compared to classic forecasting fashions, the effects demonstrate that a hybrid prediction version produces drastically higher accuracy and offers an extra sensible representation of the device's behavior. The paper evaluates hybrid prediction fashions to alternative strategies and a few viable future development directions.},

We describe the environment representation model used, the Stixel World, and its benefits for compact scene representation. We show our preliminary results of its application in a diverse environment and the limitations reached in our experiments using imaging systems. We argue that this method has been developed in an ideal scenario and does not generalise well to uncommon changes in the environment. We also found that this method is sensitive to the quality of the stereo rectification and the calibration of the optics, among other parameters, which makes it time-consuming and delicate to prepare in real-time applications. We think that pixel-wise semantic segmentation techniques can address some of the shortcomings of the concept presented in a theoretical discussion.},

It presents some of the key concepts and tools as a summary: trustor/trustee separation, trust relationship description, virtualisation and trust, and trust domains. The flip side of thinking about the trust relationships that one system will form to other systems is for architect to consider the place of the system as a trustee: the recipient or target of those trust relationships. A key point is that the architect of trustee system should aim to have a good understanding of not only the functional uses to which the system may be put but also the trust contexts and risk concerns of potential trustors. Trust and risk lurk in all areas of the field of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest supercomputer, from wind turbines to online gaming, and from financial markets to educational institutions.},

Schizophrenia detection using Electroencephalography is an en-grossing area of neuroscience. There are several researches reported on designing effective models which can detect schizophre-nia accurately, however, existing models are either complex or use an extensive number of waves to process for detecting schizophre-nia accurately. Addressing the issues mentioned above, this work presents a lightweight Schizophrenia detection model with the help of Gamma wave extraction from the electroencephalogram brain waves. The proposed model has approximately 12500 parameters with an accuracy of 99.5 % which is much lighter than the previous state-of-the-art models that contain nearly 11 million parameters. We also presented a detailed comparative result analysis among all the state-of-the-art models with the proposed model which shows the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Breaking through the thinking set of parallel algorithm design and parallel programming, an actual problem, the numerical weather prediction post-processing system, is parallelized by using a job-level parallel method. By parallelizing the execution of program, the wall-time of post-processing system is decreased evidently and ideal parallel efficiency is obtained. This case can be regarded as a paradigm of extensions of parallel execution model.},

  abstract={Providing high quality recommendations is significant for e-commerce systems to assist users in making effective selection decisions from a plethora of choices. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most well-known and successful techniques to generate recommendations. However, CF suffers from an inherent issue that does not think over the auxiliary information such as item content information. This paper proposes an approach to combine the similarity of auxiliary information with the similarity of items based on user-item ratings. Specifically, due to the high dimensions and linear correlation of the auxiliary information, this paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension to improve the predictive accuracy. In addition, Pearson correlation is better than the Euclidean distance as the similarity measurement to predict accuracy of preference value through the analysis of the different experimental results. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our approach.},

Especially inventory and transportation occupy a considerable proportion in logistics cost. So reduce the cost becomes the key to reduce it. However, China's enterprises consider how to reduce transport cost or inventory cost only, ignoring the relation between the two parts, making the logistics systemic operating cost high. The paper takes full consideration of antinomies of transportation and inventory cost and use systemic thinking to low the operating cost in order to provide a solution to the two costs.},

To address this problem and figure out the unknowns hidden in educational datasets, this paper proposes the historical views navigation though similarity and closeness centrality based recommendation. In this approach, the useful intermediate views or the views interested by users are saved as history and compared with the current view. By analyzing the similarity between them and the closeness centrality measure, the most relative historical views are recommended to the user. Finally, the user study shows that most of the participants are interested in our work. They think it's helpful and will continue to use it.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Maize crops get hit hard by corn rust, a big disease that affects farming all over the world's food production. Traditional ways of finding diseases and putting them in groups are basic, but often limited by what people think about it. They don't work well when needed for a large number of cases. This study shows a new method using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is deep learning (DL). It helps to correctly identify the degree of damage from corn rust disease. The study shows that the MLP model works well in finding and classifying disease stages using a set of 3500 and pictures from six levels. The MLP model was carefully made and taught to recognize small changes in disease levels. It puts importance on being right, exact, and remembering everything about it all the time. The machine reached 94.20% accuracy, showing it could be useful for people working with plants and those who farm. The MLP was faster, more scalable, and gave better results than other computer learning methods. It did a great job! This study aids the increasing mix of artificial intelligence and farming that's precise. It shows how DL can help solve tough agriculture problems. The results show that the MLP model can help manage crop diseases. It helps in quick and effective actions to stop these problems from causing more harm. For the future, we want to make the model stronger. We also plan on using it for other sicknesses and adding it to farming systems that check things in real-time right away. The research opens the door for better farming methods that are both green and save energy, driven by smart machines.},

  abstract={Proper Pronunciation is essential for a successful career. In the present era, recruiters do not want mug pots or rote learners i.e one that scores well in the technical or the core area. The need of the hour demands a holistic personality which must include good communication skills, critical thinking, managerial skills & logical reasoning. In the present study, the researchers have studied the mother tongue influence (MTI) in the English language spoken by the regional speakers of the Kumaun region. In the present study, the researchers have observed that the students of Uttarakhand have high MTI (Mother Tongue Influence) which is noticeable in their communication. They face difficulty in articulation of certain consonant sounds like sh (ꭍ), v, w, etc. Words like sheep /ꭍi:p/ are mispronounced as seep /si:p/, career/kₔriₔ/ as carrier /kᵆriₔ/ (Kay-rier). Due to poor pronunciation, they face challenges not only in the recruitment process but also in survival in Multi-National Companies where the American / British accent is widely used. The researchers conducted a diagnostic test to identify the extent and frequency of flaws in the articulation of words. It was observed that the performance of the regional learners was poor and required improvement. They implemented a Pre-Defined Algorithm model for improving the performance of the regional students. It was followed by a post-implementation test which was conducted through the proposed model. The proposed model has a better outcome concerning reducing the MTI in general pronunciation of the English Language among Kumauoni speakers of Uttarakhand.},

  abstract={This unprecedented time of the COVID-19 outbreak challenged the status-quo whether it is on business operation, political leadership, scientific capability, engineering implementation, data analysis, and strategic thinking, in terms of resiliency, agility, and innovativeness. Due to some identified constraints, while addressing the issue of global health, human ingenuity has proven again that in times of crisis, it is our best asset. Constraints like limited testing capacity and lack of real-time information regarding the spread of the virus, are the highest priority in the mitigation process, aside from the development of vaccines and the pushing through of vaccination programs. Using the available Chest X-Ray Images dataset and an AI-Computer Vision Technique called Convolutional Neural Network, features of the images were extracted and classified as COVID-19 positive or not. This paper proposes the usage of the 18-layer Residual Neural Network (ResNet-18) as an architecture instead of other ResNet with a higher number of layers. The researcher achieves the highest validation accuracy of 99.26%. Moving forward, using this lower number of layers in training a model classifier, resolves the issue of device constraints such as storage capacity and computing resources while still assuring highly accurate outputs.},

  abstract={In the modern information age, computers, multimedia and various technologies influence people's learning to a very large degree. College English teaching is no exception. “College English Curriculum Requirements” issued by Ministry of Education emphasize the importance of applying modern information technology into college English teaching, changing the traditional teaching system and constructing the multimedia- and network-based teaching model. However, the mere application of these information technologies is far from enough. Some problems have already appeared. So it is very necessary to take some guiding theories into consideration. Embodied philosophy puts special stress on the spirit of “people first”, which brings important inspiration for college English teaching. Starting from the perspective of embodied philosophy, the paper explores the essence of English teaching. That is “interactive experience”, which can be divided into three parts: with what to experience, what to experience first and how to experience. It hopes to activate teachers' and students' thinking and experience, in order to make computer-assisted college English teaching more practical and effective.},

  abstract={Queuing network techniques are effective for evaluating the performance of computer systems. We discuss a queuing network technique for computer systems in finite input source. The finite number of terminals exist in the network and a job in the network moves to the server that includes CPU, I/O equipment and memory after think-time at the terminal. When the job arrives at the server, it acquires a part of memory and executes CPU and I/O processing in the server. After the job completes CPU and I/O processing, it releases the memory and goes back to its original terminal. However, when the computer system has the memory resource, the queuing network model has no product form solution and cannot be calculated the exact solutions. We proposed here an approximation queuing network technique for calculating the performance measures of computer systems with finite input source on which multiple types of jobs exist. This technique involves dividing the queuing network into two levels; one is "inner level" in which a job executes CPU and I/O processing, and the other is "outer level" that includes terminals and communication lines. By dividing the network into two levels, we can prevent the number of states of the network from increasing and approximately calculate the performance measures of the network. We evaluated the proposed approximation technique by using numerical experiments and clarified the characteristics of the system response time and the mean number of jobs in the inner level.},

Under the impact of this wave, methods based on large-scale data, such as deep learning, have been put forward, and scholars have begun to think about many classical tasks from a new perspective. The LDA model is used to mine the topic information in the texts in parallel corpora, and the polynomial distribution of thesaurus is used to represent the topic, so as to judge the proportion of each document topic in the document collection. The specific words are obtained according to the polynomial distribution of the corresponding thesaurus of the topic by probability sampling. The monolingual corpus of the target language is processed by maximum likelihood estimation method, and the parallel corpus is taken as the training target. The monolingual corpus of the target language is estimated by importance sampling and full probability formula, and a machine English translation model is established. The estimated expected value is obtained by beam search method, so that English sentence translation can be realized. When disambiguating 2000 groups of random phrases, the correct rate of word sense disambiguation was 79.9%, and the correct rate of structure disambiguation was 85.7%, which was 8.6% and 3.9% higher than the original system respectively.},

  abstract={Neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) techniques are gradually replacing true critical thinking. These methods surpass logical and quantitative approaches because they can handle massive boundaries in massive amounts of data and dynamic behavior over time. This article lays the groundwork for adaptive traffic control by proposing ML and DL calculations for crossing point traffic flow prediction. Adaptable traffic control can be accomplished by adjusting traffic light timing based on expected flow or by controlling traffic lights partially. That is why traffic flow prediction is the only focus here. The suggested ML and DL models are created, approved, and tested using two publicly available datasets. The first one gives a total of all cars analyzed by various sensors over a 56-day period, including clocks placed at six different crossroads. The ML and DL models used in this study were developed using four out of the six crossings. Subsequently, Multi-facet Perceptron Brain Organizations (MLP-NN) dealt with Irregular Backwoods, Direct Relapse, and Stochastic Inclination; MLP-NN required less preparation time but produced better results (R-Squared and EV score of 1.93) than Intermittent Brain Organizations (RNNs), which produced excellent measurement results but required more time overall. All ML and DL computations have excellent execution results, which makes them a good fit for intelligent traffic light management.},

  abstract={The author discusses the following questions about the IT market: Why is the commercial IT market organized unlike other markets? That is more challenging to answer than you would think. The IT market seems to change more quickly than other industries, and it seems to use frontier technologies more often. Neither trait is unique to IT, however, financial markets change quickly. Biotech uses frontier technology. Why does the presence and combination of quick change and frontier technology seem so special to the organization of IT markets? Here is a related puzzle. Over the last five decades, many parts of computing and networking have become compartmentalized into submarkets. Specialists inhabit each category and sometimes work with specialists in other categories, and sometimes not. Sometimes a single firm works in many of those submarkets, and sometimes many independent entrepreneurs do. While compartmentalization itself is not unique to IT - the automobile supply chain possess similar features, for example - the IT market witnesses frequent rearrangement of those categories, and the leading firms therein. Sometimes it is orderly and sometimes not. How did it get to be that way? The combination of technical interdependence and technical improvement in fundamental components results in frequent restructuring and mismatches. Difficult to manage, and always entertaining to watch, no other market behaves this way. Two decades ago all the energy went into adjudicating potential abuses of leadership at Microsoft and Intel. Two decades earlier it was IBM. These days the focus stares at Alphabet/Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That kind of rapid turnover in leadership happens in no other market.},

While improving the efficiency of education management, it is necessary to emphasize comprehensive thinking of the entire management process. Its basic idea is to use the created model to explain the changes of dependent variables with the changes of one or more independent variables, and find out the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variables through then testing the model. Besides this, the Python is adopted for the systematic implementations. Python is a pure object-oriented language that supports all object-oriented mechanisms, which makes it applicable to large-scale software project development. Using this tool, the designed model is validated through the further simulation. Compared with the other methods, our design model cam evaluate better.},

  pages={104-108},
  abstract={To explore the application effect, problems and countermeasures of the hybrid curriculum based on MOOC+ SPOCs in `Medical Data Processing and Its Implementation in MATLAB'. In the first round of the research, 59 medical students (from the 2018 class), who participated in the course, were divided into the experimental group and the control group. The LBL teaching method and the MOOC-based hybrid curriculum teaching methods were adopted, respectively. The effectiveness of the mixed method online and offline teaching mode was measured by a satisfaction survey and by comparing the examination results of the experimental group and the control group. Then, a second round of research was carried out. Asynchronous SPOCs were built on the basis of MOOC, and this kind of hybrid curriculum teaching was adopted. The online learning behaviors of 59 medical students of 2019, who participated in the course, were also analyzed. The average score of the experimental group (84.52±5.792) was higher than that of the control group (80.08±7.815). The results of the questionnaire showed that 72.6% of the students in the experimental group were willing to accept mixed curriculum teaching based on MOOC. The results of the second round of research show that there is a positive correlation between SOPCs online course scores and final scores, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.407 (P=0.001). The final scores of the course were generally over 70 points, and there was no linear correlation between the duration of watching learning videos and scores. The hybrid curriculum teaching based on MOOC+SPOCs can improve students' computing thinking ability and the teaching effect has been proved to be effective. Students have a high degree of satisfaction with this teaching mode. However, there were still some problems need to besolved in the future.},

  abstract={Nowadays in several criminal cases the progress makes us to think whether justice persists. In existing system, many news, and articles state that the victim data is manipulated, and records are changed by the officials. To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure system rendering justice with transparency which makes the court decision making easy. In the proposed Justice Secure Model, the victim voice data and records are prevented from data tampering using security policies. The criminal voice data are transformed into text using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The voice data and records are secured by encrypting using Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA 256). To validate the access request, each victim records are embedded with private key. These private keys are securely transmitted by encrypting using modified AES algorithm. The above steps would avoid the internal data tampering and manipulating the victim case data. To address the external intrusion, our proposed methodology detects and prevent SQL injection attacks. Finally, to provide security of data at the server level, we have integrated multiple cloud storage system. The proposed system provide security at the application and server levels, thus making the unauthorized data access, intrusion, and data manipulation impossible.},

To increase the value of creative thinking, ideas have to be transformed into wealth production through generation, promotion, and distribution of appreciated products and/or services in a timely and competitive way. To achieve these goals, philosophies of institutions and (virtual) organizations need to be nurtured to promote collective creativity and transformation of ideas into wealth production. The main objectives of the study are to explore and identify design principles for virtual innovation communities and to model innovation as an evolutionary process. A simulation study is conducted to systemically study and generate hypotheses regarding governance mechanisms that improve innovation output. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.},

  abstract={This article describes how quantum systems can be used to replicate complex physical occurrences, with emphasis on the use of new quantum algorithms and special data sets. First, let's talk about how quantum computers can handle big and complex data sets that are too hard for classical computers. The focus here is on the use of quantum computing methods. The main focus of our school assignment is on developing and executing quantum algorithms specifically designed to analyze and evaluate these datasets. These quantum algorithm allows us to model a complex system. Explain the basic of tool that can be used to quantum material properties. Instructions: Change the word ‘formulas’ into another Word and rephrase the sentence accordingly. The study proposes using quantum algorithms to handle large data collections. We explain how to transform classical data to quantum representation for clearer comprehension. Also illustrated is how this encoding may yield simulated outcomes. This approach ensures precise and reliable simulations. Unlike ordinary data storage and correction, quantum computing presents various problem-solving obstacles. To remove these challenges, the simulation is made painstakingly precise and dependable. Case studies may show how quantum systems can simulate complicated situations like astronomical object motions and subatomic particle activity under harsh conditions. These case studies show that quantum simulation can address issues traditional approaches can't. Our findings might affect future study, and quantum computing could transform our knowledge of complex physical events. We also discuss quantum computing and coding's pros and cons, encouraging creative thinking in this fascinating topic.},

  abstract={This research deals with the analysis and detection of current mental state including feelings, emotions and mental processes from body language signs, such as analysis of personality traits, psychological states, mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction and lie detection. In this study, we discovered this new approach to classify a person's current mental state through convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the analysis of eye, mouth and hand positions. We use extensive data to train and evaluate our model, which includes video recordings and images that record various human activities and emotions. Pre-processing techniques including normalization and scaling are used to improve model reliability. We use a CNN architecture that is optimized for feature extraction from facial and hand movements and uses both spatial and temporal information from the input data. By extracting the main features of the eyes, mouth and hand positions and movements, we try to capture subtle clues that indicate different emotional states such as happiness, sadness etc., as well as cognitive processes such as thinking, imagining and creating. Experimental results show promising classification accuracy for detecting different mental states, with better performance than basic methods. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between body language and mental states, contributing to the understanding of human behaviour. The proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications, including Psychological and behaviour analysis, mental health assessment, personal user interfaces etc. This proposed model is simply an artificial intelligence based psychologist.},

  abstract={It is difficult to use the traditional image segmentation method to segment the complex object whose boundary is blurred from the background. The active contour model, based on level set, is widely used in recent years and selected to segment this type of object in this paper. To increase the speed of segmentation, the fast active contour model without need to solve partial differential equation is used in this paper. This paper proposes a new way of thinking about designing the data-dependent speed function in the fast active model and gives the corresponding general speed function. The probability estimate theory and the conventional CV model are introduced into the data-dependent speed function, and then this paper proposes two novel fast models which can be called histogram-based fast model and CV-based fast model. The two models are studied both theoretically and experimentally. Finally a conclusion can be drawn that the histogram-based fast model is applied to segment the complex object from the background.},

Quantification of this complex and dynamic construction innovation system is complicated as it includes a range of components such as information, resources, strategies, time and uncertainty. To map and conceptualize the system, system thinking and participatory techniques have been used. Methods employed academic and industry consultation and stakeholder engagement through participatory interviews.

  abstract={Multicore and manycore processors are now ubiquitous, but parallel programming remains as difficult as it was 30-40 years ago. In this talk, I will argue that these problems arise largely from the computation-centric abstractions that we currently use to think about parallelism. In their place, I will propose a novel data-centric foundation for parallel programming called the operator formulation in which algorithms are described in terms of unitary actions on data structures. This data-centric view of parallel algorithms shows that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiquitous even in complex, irregular graph applications such as mesh generation and partitioning algorithms, graph analytics, and machine learning applications. Binding time considerations provide a unification of parallelization techniques ranging from static parallelization to speculative parallelization. We have built a system called Galois, based on these ideas, for exploiting amorphous data-parallelism on multicores and GPUs. I will present experimental results from our group as well as from other groups that are using the Galois system.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Business process models have gained significant importance due to their critical role for managing business processes.Still, process models display a wide range of quality problems. For example, literature reports on error rates between 10% and20% in industrial process model collections. Most research in the context of quality issues in process models puts a strongemphasis on the product or outcome of the process modeling act (i.e., the resulting process models), while the process followed for creating process models is only considered to a limited extent. The creation of process models involves the elicitation of requirements from the domain as well as the formalization of these requirements as process models. In this presentation the focus will be on the formalization of process models, which can be considered a process by itself-the process of processmodeling (PPM).In particular, this keynote will discuss how the PPM can be captured and analyzed. For this, it will present a specialized modeling environment, which logs all interactions of the process modeler with the modeling environment, thus, providing the infrastructure to investigate the PPM. The keynote will also shed light on the way how process models are created, present different behavioral patterns that can be observed, and discuss factors that influence the PPM, e.g., modeler-specific factors like domain knowledge or process modeling competence and task-specific factors. In addition, the keynote will provide an outline on how methods like eye movement analysis, think aloud, or the analysis of bio-feedback (e.g., heart rate variability)might enable even deeper insights into the PPM.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={The Intellectual style Inventory (ISI) is a psychometric assessment tool that identifies the preferential style in thinking and in perception for each person. The perception style is concerned with the way our minds usually focus attention regarding sensory inputs from the external environment as well as internal influences. The Integrated model of mind (IMM) is a psychological model that describes how encoding processes take place differently by various memory systems according to perception style preferences. The present work shows a cognitive model for perception in light of the ISI and IMM. It suggests a different encoding sequence performed by the different memory systems that correspond to each of the four perception styles identified by the ISI. The model was then converted into an applicable form; an electronic device (embedded system) that would help to identify the different types of memory systems and the image schema produced by any person according to his score on the ISI. The electronic device could be regarded as the mental finger print identifier for any person and could be perfectly used to manage memory and learning problems and to explore mental abilities and powers. It is made up of three main parts: the Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD AlphaNumeric 20×4 LM044L and Keypad 3×3 and programed using the C-language then simulated using Proteus Design Suite. The device is unique in its function, in the programing strategy and in its relation with the external environment.},
