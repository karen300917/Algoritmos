  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is revolutionizing medical information access and professional advice delivery. This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies. Results showed that the Qwen-VL-Mediacal model achieved a Rouge-1 score of 0.6147, indicating its potential for medical applications. However, challenges remain, such as understanding complex scenes and abstract concepts. Future research will aim to improve the model's adaptability and reasoning capabilities.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of modern information technology, English learning methods and approaches are gradually diversified, especially the English electronic dictionary, which makes English learning easier. The quality of translation is an important criterion to measure the results of English interpret, which is mainly characterized by errors in translation characters or spelling, inconsistent expression, lexical and grammatical errors, etc. At present, the most advanced machine translation method, the so-called phrase-based model, is only limited to the mapping of small text blocks. Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation. Based on modern intelligent identification technology, this paper studies the development of English intelligent proofreading system, grasps the user's behavior data through behavior log, and optimizes the system. The software part of the system PP. adopts the computer intelligent proofreading method based on the improved phrase translation model to find the correct words to replace the words to be proofread and realize the intelligent proofreading of English interpret.},

  pages={171-174},
  abstract={Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges for primary and secondary teacher capacity development. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher’ s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.},

  abstract={The demand for well-trained nursing professionals is ever-increasing, necessitating efficient placement processes post-graduation. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of balancing model performance with interpretability. Further research and implementation efforts are warranted to refine predictive modeling approaches and seamlessly integrate them into nursing education and workforce management practices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nursing practice and patient care delivery.},

  abstract={At present, the interior design computer effect drawing is divided into two ways. The first is the ubiquitous multi-software production scheme. The scheme uses two-dimensional software autoCAD or CAD software to provide basic drawing information, and then uses three-dimensional software 3 DMANX to make three-dimensional drawings. In addition, the model is rendered by VARY Tenderer. Finally, the overall modeling effect is rendered by PS technology. Although this scheme is a widely chosen production process for producers, there are still unreasonable problems, including size, modeling sequence, modeling test and mapping efficiency. The second is the CASD software developed by the Chinese Academy of Architectural Sciences, which has the characteristics of super integration and precision, and is more efficient and practical than the previous production process. Therefore, this paper will optimize and improve the two cartographic schemes in the above market.},

  abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) have become so popular that it has changed the Internet to a more collaborative environment. Now, a third of the world's population participates in OSNs, forming communities, and producing and consuming media in different ways. The recent boom of artificial intelligence technologies provides new opportunities to help improve the processing and mining of social data. In this article, an algorithm that can detect communities in the OSNs using the concepts of granular computing in rough sets is proposed. In this information model, a social network as a rough set granular social network (RGSN) is modeled. A new community detection algorithm named granular-based community detection (GBCD) is implemented. This article also defines and uses two measures, namely, a granular community factor and an object community factor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four real-world data sets as well as computer-generated data sets. The model is compared with other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for the values of modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Omega index, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-measure. The cumulative performance of the GBCD algorithm is found to be 3.99, which outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},

  abstract={The pandemic caused by Covid-19 – Coronavirus forced government authorities to take quick action against the virus, within the framework of these measures, borders, social distancing, confinement, cancellation of face-to-face attendance and implementation of teleworking were interrupted, and effective solutions were sought for the protection of physical health and care of life. However, mental health was neglected, triggering depression, anxiety, different types of violence, suicidal ideation, and action, among other factors. Directly affecting individuals in their environment, emotions, and perceptions. With the understanding of the demands in mental health care, the research team made an interdisciplinary proposal focused on the inhabitants of the department of Cauca, methodologically used a mixed research approach, applying qualitative instruments such as focus groups, debates with experts, discursive analysis; in quantitative, analysis of secondary sources, compilation, and review of reports. As a result, a technological platform was built to favor decision-making by state actors, a virtual learning object, a training process for 210 actors such as technical assistance, installed capacity in the 42 Municipalities of Cauca, a base document for the formulation of public policies in mental health and primary care for 60,000 people through face-to-face visits or teleorientation.},

  abstract={Computational chains which 'remember' that a computation has already been performed and its results are available for further use have been implemented using special classes of Matlab containers. A simple version management mechanism keeps track of any changes made to containers in the chain, and supports storage and retrieval of design data. Computational chains can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated version of management mechanism for maintaining a complete design-history database. Advantages of the computational chains become more apparent as the complexity of the work undertaken with them increases, so in this paper we describe quite a complex 'case study', which we think is a fairly typical of part of an industrial control system analysis. It is based on the use of a multivariable Smith predictor for a multivariable plant which contains time delays.},

  abstract={The objective of present research is comprehensive study related to 5G technology of mobile communication for year 2020 in Indian prospective. The European and American forums started thinking seriously about the next generation of wireless and mobile communication for 2020. A European forum named METIS, Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty (2020). Information Society started working on funded project to identify the 5G future scenarios especially in European environment. METIS funded project also involves many leading technology companies. The guidelines decided by these projects will become basis of shape of fifth generation of wireless technologies. The 4G concept shave already moved to standardization phase, we must begin to work on the building blocks of the 5G networks.5G technology will provide low battery consumption, more secure features and 4A's paradigm ie any rate, anytime, anywhere and affordable. There is a need to study local scenarios and information technology related local demand to give a direction to 5G technology development. The future technology is required to be indigenous, capable to handle local social and economic issues so that use of Information technology may be able to address our issues more effectively. Presently, most of the Europe and USA may not be compared with India, China and third world. Better infrastructure, better economy and less population are some features of Europe and USA. There challenges are different and they develop technology for their growth. In most of the cases we adopt it large cost. Applying technologies in core and routed social aspect is big challenge for nation like India. As our technology and our needs and wants are different from front runners, we need to design the technology more judiciously and economically. We need a technology which enables poor person percentage to grow fast. In this view, we have indentified our own scenario and technological requirement to implement 5th generation of mobile and wireless technologies.},

  abstract={People nowadays cannot think of even a single moment without the internet. Doubtlessly, web applications are currently the key to all change in the world. The features and facilities of web applications make our lives easier and also demonstrate different channels of communication and exchange of data. The number of internet user is increasing day by day in Bangladesh. Web applications are not only encouraging internet users to easily receive diversified services, but also creating new opportunities in every business sector. With the help of web applications, businesses can easily enhance the quality of their services to consumers with minimal effort. However, at the same time, many threats have arisen as a result of the misuse of this technology. Cyber attacks could emerge as a major threat to the digital transformation of Bangladesh, given the vulnerability in web applications caused by careless coding during the development of such applications. During our review, we observed that the existence of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the web applications of Bangladesh was very critical. This paper explores in detail the harmful web application vulnerability attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on Remote File Inclusion (RFI) as well as Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi), and their impact on the applications of Bangladesh.},

  abstract={It is very difficult for students who do not have a business career or experience to understand business models or structures. In addition, business models from the student viewpoint remain largely within a model-based understanding, and students do not have practical opportunities to create an image of business uncertainty. Our goal is to provide an experimental learning environment beyond the level of the students' hypothetical thinking about uncertainty in business. We have developed a versatile participatory simulation environment as an active learning environment for the university classroom. We apply a multiagent-based approach to represent the uncertainty of the business environment. This paper introduces one of our active learning programs, the Croquette Factory Game, for understanding business interaction with uncertainty. We show that this program provides beneficial educational effects for students in understanding a business model with uncertainty.},

  pages={206-211},
  abstract={Suicide is a very critical and important issue in modern society. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for college and high school students. Social media allows students in the digital environment to share their suicidal ideas and thoughts with others. Accurate and early detection and prevention of suicidal ideation in students can save the students' lives. To identify the risk factor for suicidal attempts, a suitable method of analysing the suicidal behaviour of students using their sentiment text posted on social media can be used. This paper presents an optimized Dragonfly algorithm (DFA) using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the automatic detection of suicidal ideation in students. In our CyberHelp Solution, the proposed DFA-based DBN model analyses student social media data, predicts suicidal behavior, and treats students appropriately. The sentiment analysis performs automated categorization of online messages and makes accurate predictions of the student’s suicidal behaviors. The dragonfly heuristic optimization algorithm is used for tuning the hyperparameter in the deep belief network. The proposed DFA-DBN technique has been implemented to predict suicidal ideation in students with a higher accuracy of 95.5% compared with other classification models.},

Today, organ donation is giving a new lease of life to many ailing patients, however can brain be added to the list of organs that can be donated? Imagine the marvels that would be back into existence if we could replicate and restore the brains of geniuses like Sir Albert Einstein or Newton or even our great leaders of the past like Mahatma Gandhi. This paper presents a literature survey on the Blue Brain technology that promptly answers all these sparkling questions. Scientists today are in research to take artificial intelligence to a level beyond everything, to create a virtual brain that could think, react, make decisions and also keep everything in some form of memory to do everything that a normal human brain can. To achieve this, the main approach is to upload an actual brain in a virtual brain. So that even after death the person's conscience would be able to function exactly as a normal brain in the form of a machine. IBM along with scientists at BMI (Brain and Mind Institute) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Research University in Switzerland are simulating the brain's biological systems into a 3D model, which would recreate the electrochemical interactions that take place inside the brain. If this simulation results in a success, the modeling would extend to different parts of the brain and make it function with all the abilities of a natural brain, thereby eliminating the chances of any brain malfunctions such as psychiatric disorders like depression and autism, which are possible in the normal brain. IBM names this project as the 'Blue Brain' project.},

  abstract={For unable to establish geometrical relationship of coordinates, conventional methods of 3D shape recovery can not be adopted to a great number of precious historical images to recover the 3D shape of the objects and environments in the images. The new method of 3D shape recovery based on single frame historical image is proposed in this paper. The core idea of this research is that, according to the change of the shade of gray of each pixel, the tilt angle and slant angle of the surface vertical vector of each object's pixel in the image is analyzed, then the depth of each pixel is calculated in response to the tilt angle and slant angle. Simulating human being's vision system and the process of thinking of brain, this method makes the process of man's 3D comprehension of single image computerize to obtain 3D digitized data. These 3D digitized data can be used in the fields of the 3D recovery of historical relics and the identification of 3D portrait and stereo literal.},

  abstract={The statement “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” was printed in the Harvard Business Review about 10 years ago. Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) have become widespread and have been utilized in research and real world applications. We sometimes get consultations such as, “Please teach me about AI,” “I want to use deep learning in my business,” or “I want data mining to do a good job of analysis. What should researchers do? In response to these consultations, I will discuss three issues: 1) problems in which the data are available but cannot be used immediately (preprocessing issues), 2) problems in which the results are difficult to explain in an easy-to-understand manner (explainable AI), and 3) problems in which the purpose of data analysis has not been identified. First, I consider the topic “when we receive a consultation, there is a lot of data, but it is not ready for use.” This is a case in which the “data ready” stage identified by the researcher is different from the “data ready” stage identified by a general person. The second topic considers the following problem “the results presented by researchers are difficult for a general person to understand.” The researcher's explanations of the algorithm and its results are very difficult. A general person is unable to judge the data analysis result from the viewpoint of “is it useful for business?” The last topic is the most difficult; A general person vaguely thinks that “AI can do something,” but “something” does not allow researchers to identify issues. I will discuss the relationship between research and practical use and what can be done from an academic standpoint.},

  abstract={Everyone has a distinct handwriting style, even identical twins who share the same genes. This distinctiveness has allowed researchers to develop systems that can classify the writer's traits, including gender, age, handedness, and others. A gender classification system, for instance, classifies handwriting patterns to predict the writer's gender. With the advancement of deep learning, it is now possible to automatically extract features from the document and classify them. In this paper, two gender classification models based on Alex-Net and LeNet-5 CNN were proposed, trained, and tested on a private Urdu handwriting dataset containing 284,000 pre-segmented characters from 200 males and 200 females. The proposed models achieved state-of- the-art performance compared to existing deep learning models for gender classification. The Alex-Net model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.14%, while the LeNet-5 model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.55%.},

  abstract={Online advertising has emerged as one of the major business models on the Internet. Publishers rely on the online revenue generated from online advertising to offer their free services. At the same time, intrusive ads such as pop-ups and animated layer ads are being perceived as annoying thing by an increasing number of Web users, because they distract the Web users from reading or navigating through the main content of web pages. It is definitely not a problem to place ads within Web pages as long as they do not become annoying. Thinking from the perspective of most users, online advertising should have a limit. It is necessary to model the intrusiveness of online advertising in order to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between user experiences and branding effectiveness. In this paper, an approach based on neural network is proposed to model the intrusiveness of online advertising. Comprehensive features of ads and hosting Web pages are exploited and effectively combined. Promising experimental results are obtained on Web pages collected from 500 Web sites.},

  abstract={Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOD) has emerged as a significant health concern in India, with prevalence rates reported between 9% to 36%. However, societal stigmas and misconceptions hinder the timely recognition and diagnosis of PCOD. A multi-modal AI-based framework for PCOD Detection and Risk Assessment is presented considering algorithms that include SVM, CNN, KNN, Otsu, and Näıve Bayes. This work integrates both image and numerical data utilizing ultrasound images, blood test results, and various patient parameters. 12 key parameters: height, weight, BMI, FSH, TSH, LH, AMH, PRL, Vitamin D3, progesterone, and RBS are considered. We conducted a survey involving 81 participants. Our survey revealed that 45% of participants were unaware of their PCOD status despite exhibiting symptoms, and 73% of participants exhibited symptoms of PCOD. 19.8% of respondents confirmed PCOD diagnoses. Our framework enhances diagnostic precision but also mitigates the emotional toll wrought by PCOD through early intervention and support.},

  abstract={Learning progress is fascinating, especially in STEM fields. When learning novel concepts and principles, the learners will try to link and compare the newly learned contents with their existing knowledge system. If the newly learned knowledge matches the built-up ones, the learners will easily merge it into their long-term (permanent) knowledge structure. When the newly learned knowledge does not match their existing structure, the learners feel confused and hard to accept and digest. In many cases, the learners learned similar concepts and principles from middle school to post-college at different levels, in mathematics and engineering mechanics. Learners might notice that some of the concepts and principles at different levels looked similar and plausible, but the critical differences didn't catch enough attention, neither the concepts themselves nor the application conditions. Even though the students heard the explanation from the instructors in the class, it does not match their existing daily life experience, which makes it harder to accept and merge it into their knowledge system. In other words, a puzzle piece was put in the blank position where it does not fit. The present study is working on rebuilding the STEM knowledge structures and exploring the differences that existed among high school students (9th- 12th graders), first-year engineering undergraduates, higher-level engineering students, and professional engineers with designed quantitative and qualitative research methods. This research aims to explore the possibility of making the transition smoother from one learning stage to another and develop a novel curriculum that could merge the knowledge structures in a new way to reduce or eliminate the gaps between different levels of STEM learning. The author of the present project was working with 9th-12th grade students from local high schools, and college students in STEM majors at a public university, to rebuild and figure out the differences in their knowledge structures for STEM learning. The project includes preparation work as the development of concept inventories in STEM fields, structured survey questionnaires for both experimental groups. The topics the author chose are concepts shared and inherited from high school STEM education, such as force, velocity, acceleration, Newton's Second Law, etc. Currently, the study focused on the feedback of their scores completing the concept inventories, while the next phase of intervention will be applied.},

When analysis and design agent model, should firstly have agent entity, then have role. We define role as a set of computation specification and function to realize relationship between two agents, establish a mapping between BDI model and role, and define an agent BDI model based on role (RA) using Pi calculus. Based on theory analysis, RA can keep balance among belief, desire and intention, and maintain model stable.

The problems of understaffing of health care personnel compared to the WHO recommendation on the one hand, and the problems of poor distribution of these health care personnel over the extent of the health care system on the other hand, lead us to think about a model of mobility and accessibility of health care in Benin. This work aims at setting up an intelligent algorithm of accessibility and mobility of health care and will allow any patient embarked at any point of the health system to be taken care of automatically by a doctor and a nurse. To achieve this, we have (i) studied the state of the art of healthcare accessibility and mobility, (ii) modeled the healthcare trajectory, (iii) developed an algorithm for the automatic assignment and management of a patient in a healthcare system and simulated it using operations research and graph tools. The work allowed to set up a dynamic algorithm of accessibility to health care and to answer the challenges of the health care systems.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of computing gate-circuit approximations of quantum algorithms, i.e., unitary operators, from the perspective of computable (effective) analysis. The scientific community thinks the Solovay-Kitaev theorem a mile-stone in quantum compiling - the task of computing gate-circuit approximations - because it proves the existence of efficient quantum compilers in an analytic sense. However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.},

Cybernetics pertains to time‐related actions that are carried out in an unstable environment. In the 1990s–2000s, it became obvious that what the pioneers N. Wiener, J. von Neumann and A. Turing had imagined was beginning to turn into reality. Of the three, only N. Wiener perhaps knew about transistors. Today, we have all the technology to provide good systemics. The chapter provides a brief view of the chronology and the main changes in teaching systems science at MIT.},

  abstract={Number of networks and their sizes in terms of connected devices are increasing very rapidly. These devices are producing massive amount of raw data for different progressive purposes that need to be processed and stored somewhere. Local data storage and complete processing of massive data will not be possible by resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) enabling devices anymore in the future. Therefore, there is a need of data storage and processing capabilities to meet the desired goals of applications. Cloud computing and edge computing are the possible solution to circumvent limited data storage and computation issues of IoT devices. This paper presents a comparative study of popular architectures in which IoT devices are integrated with cloud. For this purpose, various IoT and Cloud of Things (CoT) architectures have been studied. Strengths and weaknesses of the studied IoT and CoT architectures are comprehensively analyzed on the basis of five comparison parameters namely; resource based segregation of IoT enabling devices, range based segregation of the communication network, segregation of security solutions, cloud connectivity, and edge computing services.},

  abstract={In In fact, this era has been marked at a crossroad of technology and creativity, amalgamating and bringing up the revolutionary peak in the contemporary landscape of literature due to the induction of artificial intelligence into the production and analysis of Indonesia literature. This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence—in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs—from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.},

We give a brief view on the history of Soft Computing, we distinguish “hard” and “soft” concepts in science, and we consider the opposite pair “Hard Computing” and “Soft Computing”. We separate hard sciences and soft sciences and we give some examples for the key role that soft concepts and Soft computing could play in future soft sciences.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={42-47},
  abstract={Analysis methods are essential for the vessel-impact resistant design of bridge structures, which have respect to reasonably determine the demand and capacity of bridge structures subjected to vessel impact loading. For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.},

  abstract={In recent years, the emergence of cooperative robots has been facilitated by technological advances, including the development of safety devices. Although these robots are considerably more flexible than conventional industrial robots, when confronted with a new task, the human operator is often left to address related problems unaided. The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions. To facilitate this collaboration, this paper presents the development of a manipulator that enables two separate control centers the human brain and the robot's computational system to cooperate in solving complex, cognitive-motor tasks.},

  abstract={This paper documents the challenges in creating a computer-aided level design tool which incorporates computergenerated suggestions which appeal to the human user. Several steps are suggested in order to make the suggestions more appropriate to a specific user's overall style, current focus, and end-goals. Designer style is modeled via choice-based interactive evolution which adapts the impact of different dimensions of quality based on the designer's choice of certain suggestions over others. Modeling process is carried out similarly to style, but adapting to the current focus of the designer's actions. Goals are modeled by estimating the visual patterns of the designer's final artifact and changing the parameters of the algorithm to enforce such patterns on generated suggestions.},

  pages={115-120},
  abstract={Fuzzy logic is a way of many-valued computing logic that deals with the truth values of the variables between 0 and 1, unlike the conventional Boolean logic. Membership functions are used to depict the fuzzy values of given variable. Though membership functions are determined through expert's opinion, however, the one estimated through heuristic algorithms is the preferable methods. Membership functions determined through statistical and knowledge engineering methods are usually application dependent and cannot be applied on different datasets. This research focuses on generating the parametric values of the triangular membership function using a novel method. Initially, the Fuzzy C-means algorithm is utilized to generate the parameters values of the Gaussian membership function. Using a set of equations, these values then estimate the parameters of the triangular membership function. The proposed method is applied to the quality of web services data. From the results it is verified that the new approach of generating triangular membership functions can be adopted.},

  abstract={Sustaining open innovation requires better understanding how collaborative efforts of contributors yield collective creativity. One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of collective creativity involves how collectives govern and coordinate the actions of individuals to maximize innovation output. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in open innovation communities. To this end, we examine the impact of governance mechanisms and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source socio-ecologies. Systems model of creativity and proxy metrics for measuring potential for collective creativity are utilized to conduct a simulation study of open source software socio-ecologies. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.},

  abstract={The majority of work on artificial neural networks (ANNs) playing the game of Go focus on network architectures and training regimes to improve the quality of the neural player. A less investigated problem is the board representation conveying the information on the current state of the game to the network. Common approaches suggest a straight-forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game. We compare three different board representations for self-learning ANNs on a 5 times 5 board employing temporal difference learning (TDL) with two types of move selection (during training). The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality. A tournament of the best neural players, addition of alpha-beta search, and a commented game of a neural player against the best computer player further explore the potential of the neural players and its respective board representations},

Higher education has long taken advantage of the opportunities offered by digitisation, which greatly facilitates the lives of individuals involved in education. It is an effective and good solution for the educators, but it is also an equally effective and good solution for the learners. In this study, we want to assess the impact of digitalisation on the competitiveness of education and the perceptions of those involved in education, students and learners. We want to assess how the competitiveness of education as a key area can be improved by moving part of education from the physical space to the digital space and how this is received by those involved in education.

Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.},

This research examines the various dynamics of EI within the framework of AI integration, illustrating its importance in numerous domains. An increasing number of medical practitioners are collaborating with AI-driven systems, which creates a nuanced relationship between the analytical prowess of AI and the emotive intelligence of humans; thus, a balance must be maintained. Additionally, this study examines the effects of EI on critical facets of medical education, interactions between practitioners and patients, and overall job satisfaction. This abstract advocates for a stance that underscores the criticality of bolstering EI talents in the face of technological advancements.

With current advancements and transformations of technology and society, text-based communication has become ordinary and often even surpasses natural voice conversations- with distinct challenges and opportunities. In this exploratory work, we investigate the impact of personality on the tendency how players of a team-based collaborative alternate reality game express themselves affectively. We collected chat logs from eleven players over two weeks, labeled them according to their affective state, and assessed the connection between them and the five-factor personality domains and facets. After applying multi-linear regression, we found a series of reasonable correlations between (combinations of) personality variables and expressed affect-as increased confusion could be predicted by lower self-competence (C1), personal annoyance by vulnerability to stress (N6) and expressing anger occured more often in players that are prone to anxiety (N1), less humble and modest (A5), think less carefully before they act (C6) and have higher neuroticism (N). Expanding the data set, sample size and input modalities in subsequent work, we aim to confirm these findings and reveal even more interesting connections that could inform affective computing and games user research equally.},

  abstract={Engineering knowledge is complex. Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once. Normally, individual models and behaviours are taught in several courses, by different teaching staff and in separate years of study. This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.},

  abstract={The country's demand for talents with higher English literacy is more and more urgent in the era of internationalization. The rise and development of MOOC (Massive Open On Line Course) is explosive in China, and it has been widely used in various courses of universities, improving the teaching quality and education level effectively. ESP (English for Specific purposes), as a core course to improve students' professional English literacy, plays an irreplaceable role. Traditional ESP teaching has some shortcomings, such as single teaching mode, boring teaching process, obsolete teaching resources, etc. The teaching reform is imperative in order to meet the needs of the times. The emergence of MOOC brings opportunities for ESP teaching. This paper puts forward the exploration direction of ESP teaching based on the teaching advantages of MOOC and the teaching characteristics of ESP.},

  abstract={In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.},

  abstract={In the modern era the world comes nearer to every individual as an IT revolution where all the applications are computerized. As the level of security breaches and frauds of transaction increases, it requires highly secure identification and personal verification technologies. Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition. Experimental tests performed on the ORL and UMIST database achieves a recognition rate of 99 percent, with low computational cost without any pre-processing step.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This article explores strategies for cultivating a paradigm shift in the engineering design of intelligent machines, moving from conventional anthropocentric priorities toward a more ecocentric orientation aligned with ecological ethics. Through a comprehensive literature review, historical patterns of anthropomorphism in intelligent systems are traced, revealing how human-centered considerations have persistently dominated machine design across eras. To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity. By reforming engineering education and culture from the ground up, the creation of intelligent machines can be realigned to enrich our shared environment rather than simply maximize human primacy. This paper offers a constructive roadmap to transform the promise of increasingly autonomous technologies in the $21^{\text {st }}$ century and beyond.},

  abstract={Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.},

  abstract={People are all currently living in the world where data has changed how company think, act and plan. Data, if used correctly, might be able to become a company's sharpest weapon in fighting the competition with other companies. Inventory cost is one of the most burdening costs in the food and beverage industry with the items like degradable raw materials or fresh ingredients. If not managed correctly might become a waste causing loss to the company. Degraded ingredients also might lower the overall food quality which might result in unsatisfied customers. Managing inventory, however, is not as easy as it seems, especially with the traditional method. This paper focuses on development of accurate predictive model using computational intelligence for optimal inventory management with a case study of restaurant ingredient management. Several machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random tree, random forest, and model trees were utilized to build accurate predictive models from time series data of the restaurant inventory. With good prediction system using computational intelligence, the inventory cost and wasted ingredients can be significantly reduced, which this eventually maximizes the profit.},

  abstract={This research investigates the automatic translation of contracts to computer understandable rules trough Natural Language Processing. The most challenging aspect, which is studied throughout this paper, is to understand the meaning of the contract and express it into a structured format. This problem can be reduced to the Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction tasks, the latter handles the extraction of terms and conditions. These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning. This method is data-hungry, so the research also introduces data sets for these two tasks. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by introducing Law-Bert, a model based on BERT which is pre-trained on unlabelled contracts. The results obtained on Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction show that pre-training on contracts has a positive effect on performance for the downstream tasks.},

  abstract={The objective of this study is to develop and empirically evaluate an educational model that enhances algorithmic thinking - a key element of computational literacy - through the application with the concept of so called semantic waves for advancing K-12 students' digital proficiency. The concept of a semantic wave refers to the process of moving between abstract, theoretical knowledge and concrete, practical examples to create deeper understanding and learning. Considering this, our proposed model in the field of algorithmic thinking is intended to support pre-service computer science teachers and educators in designing instructional processes that are easy to implement and facilitate swift planning and reflection for K-12 computer science education. Initial results indicate promising outcomes but also suggested areas for enhancement. This research furthermore delves into refining the model through the incorporation of notional machines and the computational action approach for improving the training of future computer science teachers and students for the challenges of digital transformation.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described.},
