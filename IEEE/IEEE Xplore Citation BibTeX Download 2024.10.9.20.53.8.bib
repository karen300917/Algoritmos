  abstract={The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.},

  abstract={In recent years, several groups of Computer Science educators have made a sustained effort to capture the essence of CS apart from programming. Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.},

  abstract={This paper suggests a Cyberlearning tool based on a highly innovative assessment methodology that helps teachers with computer science education. Currently, there is a strong push to integrate aspects of programming and coding into the classroom environment. However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.},

  abstract={Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.},

  abstract={Promoting computational thinking is one of the top priorities in CS education as well as in other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.},

  abstract={Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.},

  abstract={Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

  abstract={As the information age has progressed, computational thinking ability to solve problems has become an indispensable way of life in life. Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course. The students in the control group first watched the computational thinking explanation video to explain the computational thinking skills to the students, and then taught in the traditional programming robotics course.},

In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability.

  abstract={Computational Thinking is an essential skill for all students in the 21st Century. A fundamental question is how can we create computer affordances to empower novice teachers and students, in a variety of STEM and art disciplines, to think computationally while avoiding difficult overhead emerging from traditional coding? Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible. Computational Thinking Tools aim to minimize coding overhead by supporting users through three fundamental stages of the Computational Thinking development cycle: problem formulation, solution expression, and solution execution/evaluation.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.},

  abstract={This thesis study is an evaluation tool that measures the user's Computational Thinking (CT) according to its performance on Block-Based Programming Languages (BBPL) by using Machine Learning Techniques. The evaluation tool makes an evaluation for Machine Learning Model and each of the Computational Thinking seven fields. Via this developed tool, the objective is to product an alternative to the limited evaluation tools on Block-Based Programming Languages. Literature research was brought out in two sides as Machine Learning and Block-Based Programming Languages. In the first stage, on Machine Learning, the data set and the methods used in educational field were researched. In the second stage, the devices which are used to measure the performance on Block- Based Programming Languages were analyzed. On literature, there are various sources for teaching Computational Thinking ,but it occurs that measuring instruments that evaluates Computational Thinking are inadequate. To evaluate Computational Thinking a machine learning model was trained. Trained model was turned into online evaluation tool by which both the tutors and the students evaluate Computational Thinking easily. In the final stage, the developed online evaluation tool and the outcome was analyzed.},

  pages={801-810},
  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking has recently returned into the limelight as an essential skill to have for both the general public and disciplines outside Computer Science. It encapsulates those thinking skills integral to solving complex problems using a computer, thus widely applicable in our technological society. Several public initiatives such as the Hour of Code successfully introduced it to millions of people of different ages and backgrounds, mostly using Blocks Programming Environments like Scratch that lower the barriers of programming and facilitate learning. In this paper we present our arguments for fostering Computational Thinking skills using a Blocks Programming Environment augmented with a Tangible User Interface, namely by exploiting objects whose interactions with the physical environment are mapped to digital actions performed on the system. Our demonstration includes a working prototype implementing our Tangible Blocks Programming Environment called TAPAS.},

  abstract={Recent college students have been observed to be motivated and engaged in acquiring information and communication technology (ICT) knowledge and skills with robots and digital media. The purpose of this study is to develop students’ technology comprehension through a learning activity by constructing robot-based storytelling systems. A sample of 15 college students participated in the program. Data collected include the pre-and post-computational thinking tests (CTt) and computational thinking skill (CTs) tests for evaluating their learning effects of technology comprehension (TC) in terms of computational thinking knowledge and skills and their perceptions toward the robot-based storytelling development environment and learning activities. The results show that the learning activities were an effective approach for enhancing the students’ TC as shown in the post-test. The differences between the students’ CT and perceptions were also confirmed. The results revealed that the learning activities with the robot-based storytelling development environment could improve the students’ TC knowledge and skills, and learning perceptions.},

  abstract={CS for ALL is a new education initiative launched in 2016 to empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy. In order to keep up with trends in the growing technology-driven world, students should have the ability to analyze and consider the consequences of computing problems critically. However, introducing CS and computational thinking skills to the first year students in college is a difficult task because the nature of the subject tends to be dry and conceptual. Thus, we introduce a computer science course that helps all undergraduate students to prepare for digital life as well as enhance their critical thinking skills through hands-on learning experiences. The course contents introduce the general concept of computer science such as computing system, basic networking, algorithms and programming with Scratch and mBot robot exercises. Our student feedback shows a high level of enthusiasm and engagement among the students. The strong hands-on learning nature of the course helped our students to have more engaging and interactive classroom experiences.},

In this paper, we describe the early stages of a project aiming to reform the CFP curriculum, such that CT skills becomes an integral part. As a first step, we carried-out four introductory workshops with 64 first-and third-semester CFP students and then surveyed them to gather their perceptions on CT. The results show that the students have a limited understanding of CT and its associated skills, but they recognize their importance. Moreover, they agree that primary school should be the starting point to develop them. The project will continue gathering information from current CFP teachers, current primary school teachers, and university professors who are experts in curriculum development, to develop the curricular proposal.},

  abstract={This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.},

Computational Thinking (CT) could be a dependable approach. This paper presents ways of ensuring synergy among engineering educators through computational thinking. A questionnaire survey that sought information from the respondents on the ways computational thinking: promotes thinking abilities, reduces personal clashes, and improves decision-making process among the engineering educators was administered to 400 respondents. 348 survey answers were returned, found reliable and used in the data analysis. The analysis revealed that computational thinking plays vital roles in the repositioning of engineering education for solving of novel problems, assurance of mutual respect among educators, and intensive research for renown engineering education with relative contribution index above 0.8. The paper recommends the development of a computational thinking based comprehensive engineering educators' synergy framework as a suggestion for future research.},

  abstract={The traditional information technology course focuses on the learning of programming tools and ignores the development of students' Computational Thinking. The emergence of visual programming tools provides a new opportunity for the training of Computational Thinking. On the basis of studying the limitations of thinking training in the traditional information technology class and the advantages of visual programming in computational thinking, this paper proposes a computational thinking training model based on visual programming. The model based on project adopt the combination of teaching plan and learning plan to design teaching and cultivate Computational Thinking. Applying this model to the actual teaching process by designing a teaching case based on the visual programming tool App Inventor, the experimental results show that the Computational Thinking of students in this model is improved in formalization and modeling. Through proposing this model and verifying its validity, we can provide the feasibility and research ideas for further studies by using visual programming to cultivate students' Computational Thinking.},

Current researches in the study of using VPLs for educational purposes primarily focus on understanding motivational benefits and computational thinking gains. All these educational VPLs claim to scaffold students learning computational thinking concepts. Although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not clear what computational thinking concepts are actually learned by students. In this paper, we attempt to develop a visual programs recognition tool for student-created StarLogo TNG simulations which representing the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students.

  abstract={Some curriculum of making computer games were developed to engage students in digital game-making activities so as to enhance their computational thinking skills during the last few years. The findings of those studies are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of computational thinking skills. However, many students seem to face difficulties in the processes of the game development, such as debugging, applying mathematics, or physics subjects. Additionally, students often have solved the problems and understood concepts, mainly math formulas and physics concepts, alone while creating their games. This study presents an innovative curriculum design that suggests two students playing different role to make motion-based touchless games (i.e., games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera or Leap Motion). Based on the requirements of the innovative curriculum and interaction technologies, students can naturally fulfill the ideal of pair programming and get various benefits from each other.},

Educational Digital Games (EDG) are a potential tool to work with CT, stimulating the student's interest and learning. Still, to make these games playable by children with Intellectual disabilities (ID), it is necessary to have adaptations suitable to their educational needs. Therefore, this paper presents the development and evaluation of the EDG “Pensar e Vestir” (PeV). This game addresses a daily life activity, the process of choosing clothes and the act of wearing them, and aims to promote the development of CT in children both neurotypical and with ID. The development process was supported by ID, Education, and Specialized Education Treatment specialists based on accessibility guidelines. In the end, there were two evaluations, firstly with the specialists and then with Computation students, to validate the functional and technical requirements. Currently, the game is in evaluation by its target audience.},

  abstract={This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.},

  abstract={Recent trends in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education are focused on developing problem-solving skills and computational thinking and empowering students with the STEM discipline's knowledge to solve real-world problems. STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving. Results have shown that integrated drone and programming pedagogy contributed significantly to students' learning of developing computational thinking for problem-solving and decomposing a problem into smaller parts in a sequence that includes mathematical algorithms to write programs.},

  abstract={Gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among students are obvious, with boys ‘CT being significantly higher than girls’. Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development.},

  abstract={Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.},

  abstract={To better understand the impact of students' personality on their computational thinking (CT), this paper develops a CT evaluation tool for college students. Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.},

Computer science, information systems, computer engineering, informatics, software engineering-these are among the smorgasbord of choices available to college students interested in a computing career. The choices for noncomputing-oriented students who want to learn about the field are even more confounding. Indeed, the established term "computer science" is not well-defined or well understood, leading to further confusion for students and their parents as well as the general public. These are some factors I view as contributing to the drop in interest in the study of computer science. The student should learn the fundamental concept of computer sciences.

Computational thinking, as one of the core literacies to be acquired in the 21st century, can help students realize the importance of computers as well as enable them to solve specific problems more effectively when facing real-life situations. The article takes the C language programming course as an example, analyzes the problems faced in teaching in the post-pandemic, introduces the concept of computational thinking and integrates it into all aspects of blended teaching design, pays attention to students' individual differences, and proposes a blended teaching model based on computational thinking and puts it into practice. The results show that this teaching model can improve students' learning performance, exercise students' computational thinking skills, and promote blended teaching reform and students' personalized development.},

  abstract={This paper introduces the notion of predicting academic performance based on Computational Thinking. The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a type of analytical thinking that is developed intentionally, that is, under a “learned” approach, and the best way to learn it is through computer programming. In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

  abstract={Programming is considered a skill to arouse and inspire learner's potential. Learning to program is a complex process that requires students to write grammar and instructions. The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.},

This paper firstly analyzes the existing problems in university computer teaching for non-computer majors, and then it discusses a series of teaching practices that integrate computational thinking into university computer teaching, including: (1) Students are divided into different classes according to their computer proficiency; (2) We abandon the concept of “Narrow Instrumentalism”, and teach the most essential knowledge of computer foundation; (3) We propose the “data” as the mainline, and then reconstruct teaching content according to the mainline; (4) We also reconstruct experimental content with the mainline, and separate experimental teaching into a single course. The practices has proved that the teaching methods put forward in this paper yield good results, and it provides a new model for University Computer Foundation teaching, which aims at improving students’ computational thinking.},

Participants were enrolled in the basic computer course from two classes at a university in central China. One class as an experimental group was chosen for the flipped-classroom instruction method (n=55); the other as a control group used the traditional lecture-based instruction method (n=54). The results show that learning through the flipped-classroom approach can significantly promote students’ levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, and critical thinking, compared with the traditional lecture-based instruction approach.

  abstract={Computational thinking is a crucial skill for students to analyze and solve problems, and programming education serves as an important pathway to cultivate computational thinking. This study combines relevant literature and utilizes Scratch, a visual programming software, to construct a gamified teaching model for Scratch courses. A quasi-experimental research design was employed, involving two fifth-grade classes from a primary school in K city. The study employed methods such as analysis of student works, SPSS scale data analysis, and student interviews to investigate the impact of gamified teaching in Scratch courses on developing elementary students' computational thinking. The results indicate that gamified teaching in Scratch courses significantly enhances the computational thinking level of elementary students, particularly in the dimensions of critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and algorithmic thinking. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that gamified teaching in Scratch courses should involve appropriate teaching tools, incorporate game-based learning, emphasize problem-solving, encourage collaborative learning, and provide training for educators competent in programming education.},

The target problem is the lack of a robust, scalable, and automated method to analyze computational thinking skills from source code written by elementary school students. The proposed method uses a variety of techniques to assess student responses, including analyzing the programming structure, programming correctness, and code execution based on certain parameters defined during the exercise specification. Analysis of the source code and evaluation of the answers to the exercises are carried out using high performance computing to improve the response time of the system. This preliminary work will contribute to a robust method for automated exam scoring, which is expected to assess and support the development of computational thinking among students.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) gained significant importance in education, leading to a surge in the development of dedicated instructional platforms. The cultivation of students’ CT skills posed a challenge, often involving the introduction of abstract and challenging-to-visualize programming concepts. This study aimed to bridge this gap by introducing an augmented reality-based coding game—an interactive learning platform designed to facilitate students in acquiring programming skills and enhancing their grasp of computational thinking concepts. The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is an important skill for solving complex problems, including processes such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic design. Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is the third major mode of thinking in the age of artificial intelligence. Many primary and secondary schools adopt graphical programming as an important way for students' computational thinking development. However, elementary school students have less self-control in learning and are more dependent on teachers, so timely and effective teaching interaction is an important guarantee for the realization of the teaching goals of graphical programming. Through three rounds of action research, the essay investigated the impact of teaching interaction strategies on the development of students' computational thinking. The findings show that students are satisfied with the designed interaction strategies, and the interaction strategies can significantly improve students' computational thinking ability and level.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.},

  abstract={Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education are widely favored by schools and teachers because both of them are student-centered learning models by allowing students to collaborate and explore around issues in order to promote the development of students' learning in the 21st century. However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. However, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers' roles.},

  abstract={The call for innovative talents in the information age is imminent. With the promulgation of the domestic high school information technology curriculum standards in 2017, the formulation and positioning requirements of the core literacy of the disciplines, computational thinking as one of the four core literacy, is the thinking ability that everyone should have. Many foreign educational practice studies have shown that mind mapping can effectively promote students' cognitive development and knowledge construction. However, the domestic educational application research is relatively lacking in this aspect, and there is little research on the comprehensive and in-depth combination of it and the core literacy “computational thinking” of the specific information technology discipline. To this end, based on the research status at home and abroad, this paper attempts to use the concept map tool to represent several important functions of computational thinking, "definition of problems", "abstract function", "build model" and "Debugging and improvement". The diagram incorporates the teaching model in the computational thinking development curriculum. This study used quasi-experimental research methods to explore the effect of conceptual map tools on students' computational thinking. The research results show that this teaching method has a significant effect on the development of students' computational thinking.},

The look and feel of traditional robots for educational purposes such as LEGO Mindstorms and NXT have been mostly engineering-oriented. Not until recently, have robotic products such as Dash & Dot utilized physical appearance which were cute and kid-friendly. This study compared the effects of using two kinds of robots- Dash & Dot and LEGO NXT, in terms of students' performance, student's attitudes about learning activities, and how different genders respond to various robots. A Quasi-Experimental Design was conducted. The participants consisted of 106 6th graders from four classes of students. Two classes were designated as the experimental groups which used Dash & Dot robots,). The other two classes of students were the control groups which used NXT robots. With respect to students' attitudes toward learning, the study showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups. With respect to learning programming skills, it was found that females in the experimental group prefer to use robots. Females showed a definite preference for using the Dash & Dot robots.},

  abstract={Building a classroom environment based on student-led, meaningful collaboration is an ideal being promoted by educators and administrators seeking to equip students with 21st century workforce skills. More and more often, teachers are challenged to design lessons that utilize students' innate desire to communicate with one another rather than more traditional direct instruction. With a heavy focus on student-driven instruction and a reduced role for direct instruction, Carson Middle School's Game Design I course is able to utilize collaboration as a means for allowing students to not only learn but master and retain Computational Thinking Patterns and apply them in formal summative assessments. Through the collection of these data points throughout the course of a semester of learning, an educator can fully appreciate the learning of Computational Thinking skills that occurs as students build a sequence of games and simulations.},

  pages={673-681},
  abstract={Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students’ creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.},

  abstract={This study attempted to investigate elementary school teachers' understandings, beliefs, and intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking. We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way. In addition, most respondents intended to continue learning and applying STEM and Computational Thinking approaches in their learning design. Added to this, the participants' understanding of STEM and Computational Thinking also improved based on the results of the Wilcoxon test conducted on the pre-test and post-test. This study provides valuable information on the need for elementary teacher development programs, namely improving teachers' teaching skills based on STEM and Computational Thinking for preparing students with 21 st-century learning skills.},

  abstract={Promoting computational thinking is a priority in CS education and other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative, NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational and creative thinking. In Spring 2013, we deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCE) designed to engage creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in an introductory CSI course for engineering students. We compared this CCE implementation semester (80 students, 95% completing 3 or 4 CCEs) to the Fall 2013 semester of the same course (55 students) without CCEs. CCE implementation students had significantly higher scores on a CS concepts and skills knowledge test (F(1, 132) = 7.72, p < 01, partial Eta2 = .055; M=7.47 to M=6.13; 13 items) and significantly higher self-efficacy for applying CS knowledge in their field (F(1, 153) = 12.22, p < .01, partial Eta2 = .074; M=70.64 to M=61.47; 100-point scale). CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p = .04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p = .006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale). The addition of computational creativity exercises to CS courses may improve computational thinking and learning of CS knowledge and skills.},

  title={The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={15},
  number={2},
  pages={213-222},
  abstract={This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

  abstract={The primary objective of this research was to investigate effective learning sequences starting with computational thinking, programming, or both. We experimented with and analyzed the learning sequence of students from the Department of Computer Engineering, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering. The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.},

  abstract={Critical thinking is one of the core missions of higher education. It emphasizes self-reflection and critical examination. There are few proven methods to teach critical thinking effectively, and assessment of students' thinking skills often fell short. Most universities do not teach critical thinking in a cohesive and systematic fashion after the students enter a specific discipline, such as management or engineering. This paper proposes to design a discipline specific critical thinking curriculum by adopting a Problem Solving Life Cycle framework. Critical thinking skills are reinforced in every phase throughout the Life Cycle with documented deliverables and assessment criteria.},

  abstract={Existing literature presents many cases of computational thinking analysis through the perspective of a skill set for 21st century. However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.},

  abstract={With the coming of the digital intelligence era, contemporary middle school students should have the key literacy and ability to quickly adapt to the current social development. Computational thinking, as a critical problem-solving skill in the era of artificial intelligence, has also become a basic literacy for students to face the future. However, the traditional “duck and filler” teaching mode is ineffective in developing computational thinking skills, while the gamified learning approach allows learners to interact with games in an immersive way. Therefore, this study combines games and programming teaching, builds a teaching model of gamified text programming, and develops a series of programming courses. It can develop not only computational thinking skills and improve students' programming ability but also effectively avoid the limitations of traditional programming teaching.},
