  abstract={We introduce a Producer-Customer model and use it to add an innovative portion to the “Digital Systems” course materials. In this work, we have developed and tested ten Intellectual Property (IP) cores, real products, which are either defective or improvable. A defective product does not function as it should. An improvable product works in accordance with its specification; however, it has potential for improvement. Two different directions are possible for improvements: performance or area. Students will work in the customer and then producer settings to diagnose and then resolve the issues, respectively. This work is an attempt to fulfill the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) Students Outcomes, hence help instill an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering undergraduates. We have received encouraging evaluations for our innovative work from students.},

  abstract={What is Computing? This simple question has been surprisingly difficult to answer, resulting in confusion about what constitutes the core of Computing. This is particularly relevant when we consider curricula for various subdisciplines of computing. Examining various issues and voices, this paper lays out an informed case for defining the landscape of computing. This work proposes a Disciplinary Boundary Model, in contrast to a socially-constructed approach for defining computing subdisciplines. This model can be used to describe the computing landscape by examining the underlying “invariant” activity of human inquiry, and suggest that it be used for defining the landscape for various computing curricula.},

  abstract={This paper presents a general framework of an innovative TOUR model with four interrelated elements: Transformation, Outreach, Unification and Reinforcement, enhancing the learning experiences of computer science/computing students via a study tour. We brought our students on an overseas trip as an integral part of an academic course. The immediate goal of the study tour was to gear the students toward the program learning outcomes. Another goal was to take a first step in supporting the TOUR model, to immerse students within these four interrelated important learning and self-improvement elements, and to support each student in becoming a better person. The study tour comprises six core learning activities aligned with the TOUR elements. Evaluations were conducted based on a student survey and self-reflection. The results provide valuable insights into the design of the computer science student study tour, as well as the potential value of the TOUR model.},

  abstract={We recently introduced a producer-customer model to fulfill the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) Students Outcomes, hence help foster an entrepreneurial mindset in students. In this paper, we use our producer-customer model to craft and add innovative lab assignments to the “Computer Architecture and Organization” course. The new lab assignments are based on the six products or IP cores that we have developed. Each product is either defective or improvable. There are some discrepancies between the behavior of a defective product and its user guide; in other words, a defective product does not work as it should. The performance of an improvable product can be enhanced. Each team of students will first work as a customer to identify the defects or the improvable aspects of a product. They will then challenge another team, the producer, to resolve the issues. We have received encouraging anonymous feedback from students.},

  title={Critical Radical Analysis Network for Chinese Character Recognition}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={2878-2884},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning is a challenging problem in many tasks due to the lack of training samples of the unseen classes. The radical-based zero-shot Chinese character recognition methods treat Chinese characters as a combination of radicals and structures, and recognize Chinese characters by identifying the radicals and structures contained in them. Current approaches generally treat the contribution of all radicals to Chinese character recognition as the same, and the recognition results rely on the network’s ability to recognize radicals and their corresponding position information, ignoring the potential value of radicals themselves in eliminating the uncertainty of Chinese characters. In this paper, we model the problem of radical-based Chinese character recognition as an uncertainty elimination problem and propose a Critical Radical Analysis Network (CRAN) to explore the Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) information for zero-shot Chinese character recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel method to compute the critical values of radicals based on information theory using the predefined Chinese character IDS dictionary. In recognition, we use an iterative approach to translate the predicted radical sequence to target Chinese characters. That is, the radicals of the predicted sequence are sorted in descending order of the critical value, and then the radicals are continuously selected in this order as the information obtained to eliminate the uncertainty of the Chinese character until the character is recognized. We conduct experiments on the CTW, CASIA-AHCDB, and CASIA-HWDB datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the ability of recognizing unseen Chinese characters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Transportation systems design might be supported by participatory approaches refining service design, user experiences, and safety research. The evaluation of mobility alternatives as design improvement strategies requires more advanced instructional techniques with new structures of complexity that can demonstrate, analyze, or compare system performances in order to achieve environmental sustainability in general and the well-being of the end-users in particular. As an emerging technology, games are capable of representing operations and management of passenger freight transportation and increase situational awareness of capacity bottlenecks. However, few research efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of the research progress. Based on the profiling methodology that has been previously employed in retrospect of healthcare simulations, this article presents a bibliometric review of games for health in transportation systems. The study carries out a literature analysis of the modelling methods to assemble gamified scenarios from a planning and managerial perspective. The Web of Science Core Collections are used to identify research items and investigate all the game-based studies in the cross-disciplinary research area of transportation and public health. The technology, game mechanism, and the health-related issue addressed are grouped into broad categories. The research findings are three-fold. (1) The majority of publications are classified into research efforts revolving around slow and road transportation modes. (2) Although scores, badges, and challenges are considered as the frequently seen gamification features, environmental simulation, avatars, and narratives appear as game mechanisms for the activation of the individual decision-making process. (3) Introducing system dynamics, human-computer interaction design, and a stakeholder accountability framework into the multi-stakeholder simulation setting leverages gaming outcomes with health benefits amid transportation system end-users. The literature study concludes with an integrated framework summarizing the best design practices between 2002 and 2022 on how the lessons learned from serious gameplay in virtual environments could translate into real mobility improvements. A selection of future research questions is curated to envisage new links between transportation and health research communities.},

  pages={15-22},
  abstract={Knowledge of monetary flow between firms can give a significant advantage both from a profit or research point of view. So-called firm-to-firm transaction networks are valuable in analyzing a market or an economy. However, such detailed and complete data is seldom available. In this work, we aim at supporting economists by reusing available financial information from different sources at different levels of detail and completeness. With our technique, experts' domain knowledge can be fused together with publicly available information to extract a representative, coherent instance of the transaction network. Supporting underspecification is important, as experts may develop partial econometric models. Our technique fills such blanks by systematically guesstimating missing information. Our approach builds upon formal foundations of satisfiability modulo theories and thus obtained transaction networks respect constraints imposed by domain knowledge and input data sources. We outline a taxonomy of general data types in the domain, and we programmatically construct formal predicates describing them. We demonstrate both guestimation of missing information of a transaction network and validation of external, expert-provided models. Finally, we investigate feasibility and performance of the advocated technique over a fragment of the Austrian economy.},

  abstract={Facing problems related to the information systems (IS) evolution and consequently decisional systems (DS), conceptual models must facilitate the organisational environment representing in which the (IS) may evolve and strategic objectives on which they must align so as to understand the imposed requirements for their development. Thus, changes have to accompany an alignment of (IS) and (DS) within optimising and strategic stakes of the company. As a solution, we suggest a multi-agent approach for the DS modelling. This approach is based on a referential framework to analyse the requirements of strategic alignment. The objective of this work is to give an overview of the DS concepts. In order to describe this central concept in the research on information systems, we will refer to all theoretical supports of these systems integrating the approach of situational decision and the question of the necessary architecture to implement these systems.},

  abstract={Dull and abstract mechanical concepts, along with cumbersome formulas, often pose challenges for students in mechanical course learning. We propose an innovative approach that combines modeling, numerical computation, and E-learning software development to enhance students' learning enthusiasm. Focusing on the teaching knowledge point of “polar moment of inertia”, we examine the automotive transmission axle as a specific research case. By constructing a finite element model and conducting numerical calculations, we generated vivid visualization materials, including Mises stress and displacement cloud images. Leveraging the C# programming language, we developed E-learning software that incorporates the calculus derivation processes for axle torsion deformation. The results of our teaching experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of this teaching innovation, with a 90.63 % acceptance rate. Visualization materials, such as Mises stress cloud images, facilitate students' understanding of abstract concepts, garnering an 89.06% acceptance rate. Moreover, the E-learning software significantly increased students' learning enthusiasm, with an 85.91 % acceptance rate. The adoption of modeling and simulation to create digital materials for mechanical education provides a robust foundation for E-learning software development and classroom application. Digitalization and E-learning software are poised to be vital trends in future educational development, with ample opportunities for further exploration by scholars in the field.},

  abstract={In access control security models, the users of an organization's information system may be granted with conflicting privileges. This is usually the case when the underlying security policy implements both permission and prohibition rules. In this paper, we propose to capture uncertainty in security models, within the framework of possibility theory. We define efficient strategies for handling conflicting privileges derived by a security policy, based on priorities assigned to the permissions and prohibitions. We show that these strategies are in line with the possibilistic management of inconsistency in security policies.},

The objective of this research paper is to identify and analyze the diverse elements that contribute to the process of pivot in early stage startups [23]. The study examined pertinent literature regarding the subject and identified several crucial elements that contribute to pivoting in early-stage startups via primary data gathering. Additionally, it assessed the influence of these key factors on early-stage startups by analyzing their effects on growth, performance, and overall success.

  abstract={The aesthetics of violence creates a visual-auditory spectacle in the films and a significant cultural ethos in the postmodern context. The combination of violence and aesthetics in the films creates a sense of paradox, subverting the audience's stereotypes about violence and evoking a new aesthetic experience physically and psychologically. To achieve such complicated aesthetic effects to a new level in the digital era, it is innovative to synthesise the literary theory, aesthetic criticism, cinematic strategies, procedural modelling and creative computation to produce more attractive and experimental stories in the film industry. Computer science facilitates the stylisation of violent films in a narrative, technical and artistic way. The paper will take Freudian psychoanalysis and Kantian aestheticism as the philosophical foundation, present an index system of evaluation and a model to compute the weight of violence and artistic beauty and further measure the effect of aesthetics conveyed by the violence. The application of the model will promote the creativity in the interactive narrative about the aesthetics of violence in films.},

A clear understanding of this often-overlooked concept is crucial for the healthcare modeling community, which is searching for better stakeholder engagement, value demonstration and quality assessment. To review and categorize this concept for modelers and evaluators, we used the Framework Method to examine 35 purposively sampled studies of agent-based and discrete-event simulation modeling in healthcare operation and policy. Four research orientations emerged in the sampled studies, ranging from academic, unilateral passive stakeholder, unilateral active stakeholder, and multilateral stakeholders. From one orientation to the next, studies engage more stakeholders in more research steps and entail distinct requirements for quality assessment. Our analysis highlights the complexity of healthcare for which the best approach to engage stakeholders, demonstrate value and assess quality depends upon the research orientation.},

  abstract={Today, computing graduates see a bright outlook thanks to the high demand for skills driven by the increasing importance of technology as the main driving force behind business transformation. As technology continues to grow exponentially over recent years, computing graduates have some of the highest starting salaries in the market [20] [19]. Even though universities have increased production of computing degree graduates in recent years, it is insufficient to fill the jobs available in the market [14]. Therefore, going forward, the demand is likely to further increase. The continued demand for computing programs in universities has led to an increased intake size, thus straining faculty workloads. Universities must consider funneling more resources into computing programs to address faculty’s increasing workload. Past studies have shown that peer learning environments enable increased productivity for faculty and enhanced educational quality for students [27] [15]. In this article, we describe a peer assisted learning model for an introductory programming course — Coders Assembly — designed and driven by undergraduate students in a computing program. Our model centers on four key areas – process, people, content, and technology. We reflect on our experience of implementing this peer assisted learning model and the result of a student survey.},

  abstract={Handloom sector in India has been there for decades and weaving has been the profession by tradition for many of the communities that have existed since a longtime. If we observe the past few years, we see that there is a decline in the handloom export and an increase in the workforce attrition in this sector. There are multiple reasons for this shift in the workforce from handloom sector to other sectors which are more promising in terms of better pay and relatively less manual labour. This paper tries to propose a new business model that is backed up by artificial intelligence and machine language algorithms that will help and enable to create a centralized platform for the weavers that can give them the direct access to the market insights, customer preferences, latest trends, customer feedback, and much more. The objective of this paper is to reduce the burden from the weaver who other-wise have no insights on the market demand or customer preferences, which creates a demand supply gap and discourages them from continuing the profession of weaving as it costs them huge in terms of investment be it money needed for the looms or the time, and energy spent behind the loom in weaving the handwoven products.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper describes an study with Problem Based Learning (PBL). PBL promotes knowledge through the motivational appeal that problematization arouses. However, there are still points to be explored and potentialized, with the use of technologies to achieve Motivation. Thus, in this study we seek to understand how students' motivation to learn can be affected by sending automatic motivational triggers (sounds, notifications, etc.) during the execution of activities, in order to stimulate certain behaviors, such as studying, doing the task, complete an activity. The methodology for the validation of the triggers was developed in two moments: (i) in 2017 with the participation of 60 students of the Software Engineering course; and (ii) in 2018 with 23 students of the second year of the Computer Engineering course. At the end of each of these studies, students' views were grouped by class and expressed through the construction of the Discourse Collective Subject (DCS). Thus, this study contributes to the discussion and presentation of the DCS as an approach capable of assisting teachers during the evaluation of the activities proposed in the classroom, mainly because it makes it possible to observe the opinion of a group as a single subject.},

  abstract={Multihop reasoning is essential in knowledge graph (KG) research and applications. Current methods rely on specific KG entities, while human cognition operates at a more abstract level. This article proposes a category-aware rule-based (CRule) approach for symbolic multihop reasoning. Specifically, given a KG, CRule first categorizes entities and constructs a category-aware KG; it then uses rules retrieved from the categorized KG to perform multihop reasoning on the original KG. Experiments on five datasets show that CRule is simple, is effective, and combines the advantages of symbolic and neural network methods. It overcomes symbolic reasoning’s complexity limitations, can perform reasoning on KGs of more than 300,000 edges, and can be three times more efficient than neural network models.},

  abstract={In the present era, mobile learning has secured a better position in modern technology base learning paradigms. It surpasses other conventional learning methods because of ubiquity, mobility, attractive content, facilitated connectivity, and institutional engagements. The main objective of this study is to identify how mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology factors influence learners and teachers when using sustainable mobile learning in higher education. Through the literature review, we developed three separate impact models i.e. mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology with separate impact factors. We used pre and post usage survey questionnaires of 60 teachers and 60 learners to evaluate these models. Primarily, they were asked to fill the pre-usage questionnaire with their initial mobile learning experience. Then, they were allowed to use the modified Moodle mobile app and asked to fill the post-usage questionnaire. The results reveal that the most significant influencing factors are, ease of use in mobile learning content, and facilitating conditions for higher education institutes and communication technology models. Finally, we can conclude that users prefer to have easy to use mobile learning content with better service facilities in higher education institutes and communication technologies.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Unlike traditional computing, soft computing solves difficult real-world problems and works with approximation models. Soft computing is more forgiving of approximations, ambiguity, partial truth, and imprecision than hard computing. The human mind is, in a sense, the ideal model for soft computing. Techniques like fuzzy logic, machine learning, genetic algorithms, expert systems, and artificial neural networks are the foundation of soft computing. Even though soft computing theory and methods were initially presented in the 1980s, automatic control engineering currently uses them as a major area of research and study. Soft computing techniques are currently being successfully applied in a wide range of commercial, industrial, and household applications. Soft computing techniques and application areas are expected to grow further with the introduction of low-cost, outstanding-performance digital processing units and the falling cost of memory chips. The purpose of this paper is to discuss embracing uncertainties and approximation for intelligent problem-solving with the help of soft computing. First, the study has discussed various soft computing systems. Moreover, the concept of fuzzy logic has been illustrated along with a description of its applications. In terms of research methodology, this research paper has followed a qualitative research approach by gathering knowledge based on reviewing a wide range of different studies regarding the research topic. According to the findings of this research, as computer processing units get cheaper and more powerful, intelligent systems and soft computing techniques become more significant. Complex algorithms must be used by intelligent systems to make difficult judgments and select the optimal solution from a range of options.},

  abstract={Due to increasing product complexity, variance and stricter safety regulations there is a need to improve safety analyses and to shift safety considerations to early stages of design. The fault tree analysis is one traditional method applied to safety analyses. Its major limitations are that it requires detailed system knowledge and involves high manual efforts. To shift it to the early stages it is necessary to improve efficiency and to cope with abstract concepts. This paper therefore, improves a matrix-based approach to automatically generate fault trees to solve the named challenges. It extends it by integrating multi-hierarchy models and enabling the automated generation of AND-gates. By that, it provides a preliminary FTA tailored to the phase of system design. It identifies critical system elements and allows the comparison of alternative concepts.},

This experimental study aims to examine students’ acceptance and attitude towards the use of game-based applications, as well as analyze how game-based learning impacts the acquisition and development of basic competences. To this end, online questionnaire responses from 135 undergraduate computer science students were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results indicate that students perceive these tools as useful and easy to use, thus exerting a positive influence on learning motivation and behavior change towards the implementation of game-based learning. Furthermore, the crucial role of game-based learning strategies in the development of formative collaborative learning is emphasized, as well as their positive influence on the acquisition of essential soft skills for the comprehensive training of computer science students. The conclusions underscore the importance of considering the GBL approach as a valuable educational strategy to motivate and enhance learning and develop fundamental skills in students.},

  pages={27197-27207},
  abstract={We introduce Mind Artist (MindArt), a novel and efficient neural decoding architecture to snap artistic photographs from our mind in a controllable manner. Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks. Importantly, our approach can directly generate a series of stylized “mind snapshots” w/o extra optimizations, which may open up more potential applications. Code is available at https://github.com/JxuanC/MindArt.},

  abstract={Object inpainting is a task that involves adding objects to real images and seamlessly compositing them. With the recent commercialization of products like Stable Diffusion and Generative Fill, inserting objects into images by using prompts has achieved impressive visual results. In this paper, we propose a prompt suggestion model to simplify the process of prompt input. When the user provides an image and a mask, our model predicts suitable prompts based on the partial contextual information in the masked image, and the shape and location of the mask. Specifically, we introduce a concept-diffusion in the CLIP space that predicts CLIP-text embeddings from a masked image. These diffused embeddings can be directly injected into open-source in-painting models like Stable Diffusion and its variants. Alternatively, they can be decoded into natural language for use in other publicly available applications such as Generative Fill. Our prompt suggestion model demonstrates a balanced accuracy and diversity, showing its capability to be both contextually aware and creatively adaptive.},

  abstract={We explore the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to automatically generate educational assessment questions. Despite the growing promise of ChatGPT across various natural language tasks, including question generation, there exists a challenge of producing content that is both reliable and desirable. This issue becomes particularly crucial in educational assessments, where the quality of the generated content and its alignment with the assessed material are paramount. This research examines questions produced by ChatGPT, focusing on their alignment with different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and their overall fluency and coherence. To assess the quality of the generated questions, we establish several scenarios for generation and subsequently evaluate the questions using both automated metrics and manual examination. Our empirical analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to produce high-quality questions; however, these questions predominantly fall within the categories of Remember, Understand, and Apply in Bloom's Taxonomy. It exhibits limited capacity for generating questions that require higher-order reasoning. Further enhancements are therefore necessary to enhance the question quality of this model, particularly with regard to the diversity of question types based on Bloom's Taxonomy. This improvement is crucial to ensure the suitability of the generated questions for effective classroom assessments.},

  abstract={Spatial agents are widely involved in robotics, simulated situations in GIS and virtual environment. Most of these agents are controlled by high-level natural language instructions or driven by limited natural language stories coming from real people. This kind of spatial information is usually qualitative rather than quantitative and is often incomplete according to the human spatial cognitive nature. This paper presents an approach to qualitative spatial orientation reasoning in 3-dimensional spatial environment. Signs in three components represent qualitative orientations in 3D space with respect to each spatial agent. By using sign algebra and efficient methods for dealing with uncertainties, the paper proposes a method for qualitative orientation reasoning between different reference agents, from which an analytical mechanism is built. The presented method can be integrated into the perception-deliberation-action control loop in spatial agent environment.},

  abstract={Representative paths analysis generalizes and improves MPI critical path analysis. To improve diagnostic insight, we sample the distribution of program path costs and retain k representative paths. We describe scalable algorithms to collect representative paths and path profiles. To collect full paths efficiently, we introduce path pruning that reduces permanent space requirements from a trace (proportional to ranks and MPI events) to path length (the minimum). To make space requirements independent of ranks and events – even a small constant in practice – we profile program paths. Avoiding the limitations of prior path profiling approaches, we dynamically discover tasks and attribute costs in high resolution. We evaluate our algorithms on seven applications scaled up to 7000 MPI ranks. Full program paths use as little as 0.01% the permanent space of current methods; profiles require a nearly constant 100–1000KB. Execution overhead is under 5% when synchronization intervals are sufficiently large (a few milliseconds).},

  abstract={This paper proposes the implementation of Chat-GPT, a large language model, as a virtual peer for peer instruction in computer programming courses. The authors argue that AI tools, including ChatGPT, can bring benefits such as personalized learning, instant feedback, and active engagement to the classroom. An experiment was conducted with two groups of programming students: one receiving traditional instruction and the other utilizing the ChatGPT-based peer instruction model. Both groups were given the same programming assignments and assessments. The results indicated that the ChatGPT group outperformed the traditionally instructed group, demonstrating better programming skills and a deeper understanding of concepts. The ChatGPT group also reported higher engagement and satisfaction. However, some difficulties were observed when using ChatGPT for more abstract problems. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a virtual peer to enhance active learning and student outcomes in computer programming courses, challenging biases regarding AI's potential benefits in education.

  abstract={Animation of topological transformations, such as fractures, cracks, tears, crumbles or fragmentations, is a new challenge in Computer Graphics and Animation. We propose a new way to model and animate topological changes, allowing the programmer to design any type of topological changes and animation mapping. This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shape-independent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on rifts and crack effects on 3D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical topological transformations associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity.},

  abstract={Various attempts have been made throughout the history of artificial intelligence (AI) to incorporate emotional support in intelligent systems. Still some paths are left untraveled. This paper presents an attempt to model emotions as a complex system based on the hypothesis that mind state can be considered as an emergent phenomena resulting from autonomous, interactive, elementary entities called emotions. Inspiration for our approach is found in Buddhist philosophical concepts about thought formation by combination of emotions. Multi Agent Systems (MAS) technology has been used for the realization of above emotional model because interactions and emergence are intrinsic features of MAS. Capabilities of the model are exposed through a virtual agent application called EME who perceives, understands, uses and expresses emotions. Evaluation of the agent implementation has shown good results in achieving emotional intelligence with enhanced quality.},

  abstract={One of the most prominent research goals in the field of mobile autonomous robots is to create robots that are able to adapt to new environments, i.e., the robots should be able to learn during their "lifetime" possibly without (or a minimum) of human intervention. When employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to control the robot, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are a good candidate for achieving continuous on-line learning. A problem with RL applied to robot learning is that the state (and action) space of a robot is typically not discrete. Thus, the robot had to evaluate an infinite number of possible actions at every time step in order to select the best. To overcome this problem we add a second network module to the neurocontroller acting as a memory of previous decisions (state-action pairs) of the robot. The robot's actual decisions, then, are based on previous decisions retrieved from memory. Additionally, intrinsic noise in the memory network gives the robot the possibility to evaluate new "ideas", hence it becomes creative. We analyze the potential of the above approach by measuring the ability of (simulated) robots to learn simple tasks using temporal difference (TD) learning.},

Solving problems of this type continuously throughout CS studies enables the students to grasp the CS professional work, and in particular the role of mathematics in the work of proficient programmers.

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents an overview of student assessment proposals for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in Computing Education. Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional student-teacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out.},

  abstract={Corporate university (CO) become a trend in organizations. However, functional characteristics are little explored by CO for boosting knowledge creation. One of them is functional diversity that has been pointed as a factor to increase innovation, contributing for the development of clear strategies and quick responses to changes at workplace. On the other hand, an appropriate distribution of roles helps to promote individual responsibility and group cohesion. It also contributes to the strengthening of positive interdependence of group members. These aspects are fundamental to the development of cooperative work. In this work, we propose a model for group formation for learning approaching dichotomous functional roles and preferred roles in order to improve the group performance into the courses offered by CO at Court of Justice of Goiás (CJG). From the proposed model, we constructed three group formation algorithms. The first algorithm forms groups randomly (AA). The second is a canonical genetic algorithm (CGA). The third is a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). After, we performed a comparative analysis of the results reached by the three algorithms. We observed that the HGA achieves superior results than the CGA and AA.},

  pages={27218-27228},
  abstract={Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.},

  abstract={Increased data availability has stimulated the interest in studying sports prediction problems via analytical approaches; in particular, with machine learning and simulation. We characterize several models that have been proposed in the literature, all of which suffer from the same drawback: they cannot incorporate rational decision-making and strategies from teams/players effectively. We tackle this issue by proposing hybrid simulation logic that incorporates teams as agents, generalizing the models/methodologies that have been proposed in the past. We perform a case study on the NBA with two goals: i) study the quality of predictions when using only one predictive variable, and ii) study how much historical data should be kept to maximize prediction accuracy. Results indicate that there is an optimal range of data quantity and that studying what data and variables to include is of extreme importance.},

  abstract={Conceptual architecture involves a highly creative exploration of novel ideas, often taken from other disciplines as architects consider radical new forms, materials, textures and colors for buildings. While today's generative AI systems can produce remarkable results, they lack the creativity demonstrated for decades by evolutionary algorithms. SCAPE, our proposed tool, combines evolutionary search with generative AI, enabling users to explore creative and good quality designs inspired by their initial input through a simple point and click interface. SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT -4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL. E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just three iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization of images by users. We use more than 20 independent architects to assess SCAPE, who provide markedly positive feedback.},

  title={Detection of Latent Gender Biases in Data and Models Using the Approximate Generalized Inverse Method}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={191-196},
  abstract={Gender bias creates inequalities in roles, expectations, and opportunities between males and females. When such biases are incorporated into artificial intelligence models, the corresponding technological solutions and products can further entrench the social biases. Herein, a new method for investigating the extent to which latent biases in text-based training data affect a language model is presented. Potential gender bias is identified by deriving values assigned to male/female words via inverse operations from embedded expressions to the original words using the approximate inverse model explanation (AIME). In particular, AIME constructs approximate generalized inverse operators for black-box models. A biased embedded representation used in machine learning models as an internal representation of word/sentence vectors likely introduces bias into the overall prediction results of such models. The OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 large language model, which provides embedded expressions, is employed to determine the gender bias included in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the OpenAI textembedding-ada-002 model is partially gender-biased owing to the training text data. These results are expected to (i) contribute to the development of effective measures preventing gender bias during the design and training of language models, (ii) promote the identification and mitigation of gender bias in future language models, and (iii) provide insights into the effect of language models and their limitations from technical, social, and cultural perspectives.},

  title={Modeling Emotion-Focused Coping as a Decision Process}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={People experience many stressful, emotion-evoking situations in everyday life. How they cope with these situations is crucial to their well-being. Research shows that people may change their beliefs to perceive the situations in a better, less-stressful light. Therefore, understanding how people change their beliefs to cope with stress and emotion is an important research question. Toward that end, we model coping, based on Lazarus's appraisal theory of emotion, as a two-step decision problem. However, people do not hallucinate arbitrary alternative realities in order to reduce stress. So a central challenge here is to model the constraints on belief change. We specifically stipulate two key factors influencing the degree of belief change: the utility of holding the alternative belief and constraints on changing a belief based on its underlying uncertainty. To investigate these factors and the model's assumptions, we applied the model to a simple hurricane situation and conducted an experiment based on this situation, where participants observed hurricane information and reported their beliefs about it. We found that when the hurricane worsens, those who stayed believe the hurricane to be less severe than the most likely outcome from the information and those who evacuated. The results also show that the uncertainty of information and the utility of the beliefs about that information is related and together determine how emotion-focused coping alters the person's beliefs. Overall, the results support the assumptions and predictions of the model. These findings illustrate the relevance of applying a decision-making model analysis to coping.},

  abstract={In the era of "Internet plus Education", precise ideological and political education is a key subject for higher education and an important indicator of contemporary college students’ education evaluation. The precise evaluation of ideological and political education focuses on the multi-source collection of teaching evidence throughout the entire process, emphasizing the multidimensional evaluation and measurement of the teaching process and its effectiveness, and providing new ideas for learning evaluation. This article draws on the ideas of teaching evaluation and combines the characteristics of the integration of online and offline precise ideological and political education. From the process of "individual student modeling learning value precise ideological and political evaluation", a multi-source data representation model is established; A multi-source data fusion method for precise evaluation of ideological and political education has been established from three levels: behavior, cognition, and communication; Furthermore, a multi-source data fusion evaluation system based on Kalman filtering algorithm was proposed, which includes four stages: data acquisition, data association, data fusion, interpretation, and decision-making. Through empirical research, it has been found that in a precise ideological and political evaluation system, multi-source data from online teaching platform logs, classroom teaching videos, learning performance and effectiveness can accurately evaluate the types and performance of students’ ideological and political learning engagement, and have a good prediction of the status of ideological and political learning engagement.},

  abstract={This study analyzes the process of online pedagogical mediation in a Distance Education undergraduate Pedagogy course based on the students’ perception of the learning experience in a virtual learning environment (VLE). Online pedagogical mediation is understood in this study as an educational and communicational process that aims at collective and collaborative construction of knowledge involving multiple mediators (human and non-human). To analyze this process, the community of inquiry (CoI) theoretical model played a central role in our study, especially in the interaction between online pedagogical mediation and the elements that constitute this model, considered interdependent and crucial for a successful higher educational experience: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. Data was collected with a questionnaire survey, which allowed us to identify the student’s conception of online pedagogical mediation and to assess the perception on the development of the presences of the CoI model in the pedagogical mediation used in the course VLE. The results suggest that most students share the perception that online pedagogical mediation is related to the role played by teachers and tutors. Regarding student’s perception of the learning experience, the results show that they positively perceive the development of the presences of the model, while also suggesting aspects of the online pedagogical mediation process that can be improved, aiming at the constitution of a community of inquiry more focused and effective in the development of learning.},

  title={New Life in Dusty Decks: Results of Porting a CM Fortran Based Aeroacoustic Model to High Performance Fortran}, 
  year={1997},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={16-16},
  abstract={The High Performance Fortran language is a 'standard by consensus', developed by individuals and vendors in the high performance computing industry, to provide a low barrier entry to parallel computing. It promises to be an easier to use development environment for distributed memory computing platforms compared to the programming complexity required by message passing libraries such as PVM and MPI. HPF promises much and is still in its infancy. Since HPF was developed in part based on experiences gained with early parallel Fortran compilers such as Thinking Machines CM Fortran, we decided to test the effectiveness of HPF with today's generation of HPF compilers by porting a complex existing model code originally developed using CM Fortran. The model code that we selected is a hybrid computational aeroacoustics code that solves the 3D, time-dependent Euler equations in the near flow field and uses a moving surface Kirchhoff's formula to predict the far field sound radiating from turbofan engine inlets. The original CM Fortran model code was developed on a Thinking Machines CM5. The extensive production research use of this model, using varying grid sizes, provides excellent benchmarks with which to compare the HPF port. Two HPF compilers were selected in the porting effort -- The Portland Group's (PGI) pghpf and the xlhpf compiler from IBM. IBM's xlhpf does not implement some elements of the HPF subset while PGI's offering provides several full-HPF extensions. porting efforts using each compiler exposed the strengths and weaknesses of each. Porting this complex code exposed many of the growing pains associated with the current generation of compilers. Critical sections of the code will be explained and these critical areas of the conversion effort will be discussed. Where necessary we will demonstrate how different porting strategies affected the performance of the code. Finally we will present how the ported code ran, using a varying number of processors, on an IBM SP2 and an SGI Origin 2000. While the current simple port does not match the speed of a CM-5, we hope further porting efforts and improved compiler technology will enable us to eventually match and then surpass CM-5 performance levels. With the shutdown of the NCSA CM-5 and the eventual removal and failure of the remaining Thinking Machines hardware currently installed, this effort will demonstrate that investments in CM Fortran code need not be abandoned and that new life can be breathed into those dusty decks.},

IoT has been studied extensively across many disciplines such as the networking, communication, security, business, and management communities. However, many unsolved challenges, especially in managing heterogeneous IoTs, remain to be discussed. Recent studies propose using blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in IoT. This article presents a preliminary study on an architecture that implements blockchain in managing heterogeneous IoT systems. We start by pointing out the limitations of prior IoT systems and the difficulties of integrating IoT and blockchain. Then we outline an architecture to manage a large-scale heterogeneous IoT system. Our main goal is to stimulate further effort and cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing guidance and reference for future studies.},

For the security of data compressed with the H.264/AVC CODEC, researchers are thinking to selective encryption. This paper presents a chaos based encryption method inserted in the H.264/AVC used for video conferencing application. It consists of the encryption of Intra prediction mode. The results show that the proposed method preserves format compliance of the H.264/AVC and has a low impact on the compression ratio. It is secure and very efficient. Moreover it can be realized in real time application. The metrics used to evaluate our scheme are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) and the Encryption Rate (ER).

  abstract={The development of adequate security solutions and in particular of authentication and authorization techniques for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Challenges arise from the heterogeneity of users, the presence of multiple security administration entities, the heterogeneity of security techniques used at the various grid hosts, the scalability requirements, and the need for high-level policies concerning resource sharing. Recent trends, like accessing grid through science gateways and the use of virtual organizations (VO) for managing user communities, further complicate the problem of security for grid computing systems. Currently, the GSI component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit, the de-facto standard for grid infrastructures is not fully suited to meet those challenges. The main drawback of such an approach is that it relies on a low level identity-based authorization scheme. .A low-level access control policy maps a user's identity (distinguished name) to a local account. Such approach does not scale and does not address many of the outlined requirements. We thus need security solutions that go beyond the simple solutions currently in use. The goal of this paper is to make a first step towards such solutions. The paper discusses and analyzes authentication and authorization solutions that better fit novel grid infrastructures characterized by virtual organizations and science gateways. Some of these solutions derive from ongoing work in current grid infrastructure projects; others are new proposals that we think worthy of discussion. In particular, we analyze the solutions proposed as part of the GridShib and the VO Privilege projects},

  abstract={Pedestrian detection can be applied to social security, and can effectively increase safety in traffic safety. In real life, there is a lot of complex background in the environment, such as illumination, occlusion, dress, attitude and perspective. Therefore, the pedestrian detection has been a challenging problems and a hot research topic in computer vision. In order to improve the detection speed and guarantee the detection accuracy, this paper proposed a pedestrian detection algorithm based on multi-feature cascade. The algorithm has two important points. The one, using the improved HOG feature to quickly eliminate negative samples to improve the detection speed. The other, using the cascade structure to guarantee the detection accuracy. In this paper, the experiment proves that the algorithm indeed improves the detection speed obviously, and prove that the algorithm is indeed effective in the improvement of these two important points. The algorithm is a research result which is obtained through study some classical pedestrian detection algorithms. And the algorithm shows the vitality of the classical algorithm and provides a new thinking way for researchers.},

  volume={30},

  pages={1102-1113},
  abstract={Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, $\text{CPFS}=(A,P)$, where $A$ is the classical PFS, while $P$ is a measurement of reliability for $A$. For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.},

  year={2021},
  volume={29},

  pages={427-441},
  abstract={Motivated by the practical demands for simplification of data toward being consistent with human thinking and problem-solving, as well as tolerance of uncertainty, information granules are becoming important entities in data processing at different levels of data abstraction. This article proposes a method to construct classifiers from multiresolution hierarchical granular representations using hyperbox fuzzy sets. The proposed approach forms a series of granular inferences hierarchically through many levels of abstraction. An attractive characteristic of our classifier is that it can maintain a high accuracy in comparison to other fuzzy min-max models at a low degree of granularity based on reusing the knowledge learned from lower levels of abstraction. In addition, our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handle the uncertainty and incompleteness associated with data in real-world applications. The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce it from data at higher abstraction levels. Experimental analyses conducted comprehensively on both synthetic and real datasets indicated the efficiency of our method in terms of training time and predictive performance in comparison to other types of fuzzy min-max neural networks and common machine learning algorithms.},

  year={2015},
  volume={23},
  number={1},
  pages={127-138},
  abstract={Commuting is an important property in any two-step information merging procedure where the results should not depend on the order in which the single steps are performed. In the case of bisymmetric aggregation operators with the neutral elements, Saminger, Mesiar, and Dubois, have already reduced characterization of commuting n-ary operators to resolving the unary distributive functional equations, but only some sufficient conditions of unary functions distributive over two particular classes of uninorms are given out. Indeed, it is very difficult to get the full characterizations of these equations because they are bound up with the famous Cauchy functional equation, which has so far not been completely solved. Along this way of thinking, in this paper, we will respectively investigate and fully characterize the following two functional equations f(U(x,y))=S(f(x), f(y)) and f(S(x,y))=U(f(x),f(y)), where f:[0,1]→ [0,1] is an unknown function, U is a representable uninorm, and S is a continuous t-conorm. These results are an important step toward obtaining complete characterization of the other unary distributive functional equations previously mentioned. Our results show that commuting is suitable for only the second equation but not for the first one. This is because solutions of the first equation are all piecewise constant functions, while those of the second equation are formulas with parameters. In addition, the two equations both have nonmonotone solutions completely different from those ones obtained.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={74111-74130},
  abstract={Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a  $2 \times 2$  factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.},

  abstract={We give new characterizations and lower bounds relating classes in the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy and circuit complexity to limited memory communication models. We introduce the notion of rectangle overlay complexity of a function f. This is a natural combinatorial complexity measure in terms of combinatorial rectangles in the communication matrix of f. Furthermore, we consider memory less and limited-memory communication models, originally introduced in Brody, Chen, Papakonstantinou, Song, and Sun with slightly different terminology. In these communication models there are two parameters of interest: The maximum message length s (which we think of as space) and the number of memory states w. Specifically, these are one-way protocols which proceed in rounds. In each round, Alice sends a message of at most s bits to Bob, receiving a message from Alice, Bob has to decide on the spot whether to output 0 or 1, or to continue the protocol. If he decides to continue, he immediately forgets Alice's message. In memory less protocols, no memory is transferred between different rounds (but Bob still has "space" to hold Alice's messages within each round). We can make Bob more powerful by giving him w memory states. He can change into a new state at the end of each round. We show that rectangle overlays completely characterize memory less protocols. Then, we go on to show several connections to the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy defined by Babai, Frankl and Simon in 1986. This hierarchy has recently regained attention because its connection to the algebrization barrier in complexity theory (Aaronson and Wigderson, 2009). We show that P^NP^cc is completely characterized by memory less protocols with polylog(n) space (maximum message length), and thus it admits a purely combinatorial characterization in terms of rectangle overlays. If Bob has 3 memory states and Alice sends messages of length polylog(n), they can compute every level of Sigma_k in the communication complexity hierarchy (for constant k), and also every function in AC0. Furthermore, we show that with 5 memory states and messages of length polylog(n) they can compute exactly the functions in the communication class PSPACE^cc. This gives the first meaningful characterization of PSPACE^cc in terms of space, originally defined in Babai, Frankl, and Simon without any notion of space. We also study equivalences and separations between our limited memory communication model and branching programs, and relations to circuit classes.},

  year={2005},

  pages={601-606},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning method for autonomous robots to obtain generalized behavioral concepts. Reinforcement learning is a well formulated method for autonomous robots to obtain a new behavioral concept by themselves. However, these behavioral concepts cannot be applied to other environments that are different from the place where the robots have learned the concepts. On the contrary, we, human beings, can apply our behavioral concepts to some different environments, objects, and/or situations. We think this ability owes to some memory structure like schema system that was originally proposed by J. Piaget. We previously proposed a modular-learning method called Dual-Schemata model. In this paper, we add a reinforcement learning mechanism to this model. By being provided with this structure, autonomous robots become able to obtain new generalized behavioral concepts by themselves. We also show this kind of structure enables autonomous robots to behave appropriately even in a novel socially interactive environment.},

  abstract={This paper deals with the specification and analysis of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). We use a timed process algebra called BTC (for Bounded True Concurrency) that we have developed from CSP and which takes into account that the available resources in a system have to be shared by all the processes. It is able to consider heterogeneous resources of any type (preemptable and non- preemptable) which makes it suitable for specifying FMS. We show by means of an example that the specifications obtained suit the real systems quite well, are straightforward and deadlock-free. Due to the great interest (and need) in obtaining shorter manufacturing lead times, we also carry out a performance evaluation using an algorithm which allows us to estimate the time required to evolve between states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do this with process algebras, and we think that it is a good way to be able to split up the system into subsystems, which will be easily analyzed without the deadlock problems that researchers in Petri Nets have encountered.},

  abstract={Traditionally, many people still wish to write on pen and paper. However, it has some drawbacks, like accessing and storing physical documents efficiently, searching through them, and sharing them efficiently. Handwriting to Text Conversion (HTC) classifies and converts an individual’s handwriting into digital form. However, HTC removes all the mentioned problems as storing, retrieving, and using the text as and when required is easier. Emotions are a basic and particularly important aspect of one’s life. To understand this important aspect of an individual’s life, we must detect emotions using affect data like text, voice, and image. We have used text as the effect data for this work. We can find a person’s emotions behind his text by sentiment analysis. Sentiment recognition and analysis is a topic with wide research as many brands, companies, and even famous personalities are very much interested in getting feedback and thus do the evaluation of their performance and knowing what people think about them around the world. Authors have proposed a model where they collected data from social media reviews and classified it into three broad categories, which are positive, negative, and neutral. Find the emotions category viz. happiness, sadness, shame, anger, disgust, fear, surprise, or neutral from three types of classified sentiments. The proposed model combined machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to achieve the best outcome.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of Dementia. It affects the brain functions, thinking ability and creates memory loss. Each stage of AD is worsening the symptoms and also affects the patient's daily activities. The current diagnosis AD detection process is not providing an accurate report for the early stages of AD. Therefore, accurate Alzheimer detection is an open challenge for the researchers. In this research, a deep learning model is introduced to improve Alzheimer's stage diagnosis. The Hybrid deep model is designed to detect abnormal changes in brain (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI scans. It utilizes the multi-class log loss (MCLL) function as the objective function to reduce the error rate in detecting AD stages. The MCLL approach computes the variations in actual and detected AD stages of each biomarkers features of input MRI images to identify loss rate. It helps to reduce the loss rate in AD stages detection. Moreover, the Hybrid deep learning model for Alzheimer stages detection (HDLMASD)system analysis the images deeply to provide accurate biomarkers detection with the help of all essential biomarkers processing steps. The efficiency of the Alzheimer stages diagnosis system is evaluated with various evaluation metrics. Finally, a comparative analysis is made with multiple present diagnosis systems to verify the performance of the AD detection system. The performance analysis proves that the AD stages diagnosis approach accuracy rate is improved up to 0.47% and the prediction error rate reduced up to 0.49% than comparison approaches.},

  abstract={Neural Style Transfer (NST) currently leads the artistic creation field that combines artistry with technological innovation, well master the advanced of Convolution neural network (CNN) makes image manipulation easy and with creative flair. This paper suggests the optimized approach for NST which includes a dataset selection, choosing the type model architecture, learning strategies and, all-inclusive evaluation metrics. Through meticulous experimentation, we explore four distinct dimensions of NST applications: face painting, super-slow-motion, interactive, user-customization, real-time performance along online social media. In investigating superior style transfer our product highlights the highest perceptual matching, faithful style representation, and content preservation metrics ensuring the fulfillment of artistic style without deformation of the original content. Model efficiency is achieved by introducing optimized model architectures and fast training strategies, which, in turn, provide for responsive style transfer in real time with as little latency and resource consumption as possible. This is done by adapting models within a specific artistic domain through up-tuning models which will be the source of style transfer that can be tweaked in a manner that caters for any artistic domain. Therefore, the paper research is fundamental because of the management of the user’s experience by user-guided interaction, which has given interactive controls and real-time feedback that assist the users to customize stylization according to their likes and dislikes. Gratifying user scoring demonstrates the power of user-directed style transfer as a means of furthering users’ engagement and artistry.t.},

  abstract={The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, WeChat, and others have grown exponentially over time with the growth of the Internet and has become the most influential networking platforms in the 21st century. They are well-known for their low-cost, quick, and effective communication. However, the enhancement of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contributes to online abuse, harassment, cyberbullying, cyber flashing, cybercrime, and online trolling. In this paper, we are focusing on cyber-flashing, the unsolicited sending of nude or sexual images, which is a common practice but often met with negative reactions from receivers. During and after COVID lockdown, cyber-flashing has been a serious threat on WhatsApp recently. The majority of study, meanwhile, has focused on identifying instances of cyberbullying rather than the effects of cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is the act of sending an inappropriate photo or video to another person, as well as exposing oneself to another via live video. An essential step in the detection of cyber-flashing is evaluating the level of risk in terms of abusiveness in the provided picture, or video. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create and refine a method that can effectively identify abusive cyber-flashing content and prevent inappropriate content sharing within the social media platforms or public Wi-Fi network. As a result, we have proposed a unique technique, where we employ a multi- stage model for identifying cyber-flashing photos and the proposed YOLOv3-YCbCr performs best in terms of metrics, with 98.14% accuracy, 95.58% specificity, and 97.27% sensitivity. First, the YOLOv3 technique is used to detect human presence in the image. Then, the YCbCr model is used for the skin detection and analysis. In the context of intelligent systems, skin detection is a difficult topic that has drawn a lot of attention from specialists and experts from the research community; the lack of uniform testing methodologies and standard benchmarks have made it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. Based on our studies, YOLOv3-YCbCr performs far better for skin segmentation than any prior hand-crafted approach method.},

Judging to check if a computer can only think will be a major understatement to the modern computer’s ability. Analogous to a human, it is not enough to only be intelligent, a human needs to communicate well to be perceived as “intelligent”.

  abstract={Over the past 20 years, wearable computing has emerged as the perfect tool for embodying humanistic intelligence (HI). HI is intelligence that arises when a human is part of the feedback loop of a computational process in which the human and computer are inextricably intertwined. It is common in the field of human-computer interaction to think of the human and computer as separate entities. (indeed, the term "HCI" emphasizes this separateness by treating the human and computer as different entities that interact.) However, in HI theory, we prefer not to think of the wearer and the computer with its associated I/O apparatus as separate entities. Instead, we regard the computer as a second brain and its sensory modalities as additional senses, in which synthetic synesthesia merges with the wearer's senses. When a wearable computer functions in a successful embodiment of HI, the computer uses the human's mind and body as one of its peripherals, just as the human uses the computer as a peripheral. This reciprocal relationship is at the heart of HI.},

  pages={301-305 vol.1},
  abstract={As the classroom paradigm shifts from being teacher-centered to being learner-centered, student assessments are evolving from paper-and-pencil testing to other methods of evaluation. Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program. This paper discusses the methods of assessment used and the results.},

From the facts of many practices, we can see that computer technology is a good technology for many industries and can bring many benefits to the industry. Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Computer technology plays a positive role in improving legislative and judicial efficiency, coping with and avoiding technical risks.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={145-158},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) architecture, a functionally-sliced microarchitecture with memory units interleaved with vector and matrix deep learning functional units in order to take advantage of dataflow locality of deep learning operations. The TSP is built based on two key observations: (1) machine learning workloads exhibit abundant data parallelism, which can be readily mapped to tensors in hardware, and (2) a simple and deterministic processor with producer-consumer stream programming model enables precise reasoning and control of hardware components, achieving good performance and power efficiency. The TSP is designed to exploit parallelism inherent in machine-learning workloads including instruction-level, memory concurrency, data and model parallelism, while guaranteeing determinism by eliminating all reactive elements in the hardware (e.g. arbiters, and caches). Early ResNet50 image classification results demonstrate 20.4K processed images per second (IPS) with a batch-size of one— a $4 \times$ improvement compared to other modern GPUs and accelerators [44]. Our first ASIC implementation of the TSP architecture yields a computational density of more than 1 TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its $25 \times 29$ mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz. The TSP demonstrates a novel hardware-software approach to achieve fast, yet predictable, performance on machine-learning workloads within a desired power envelope.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper proposes an alternative concept for handling dynamic provisioning changes and ongoing network reconfiguration and reoptimization in general. A prime motivation is concern about the dependency of existing concepts for dynamic provisioning on the real-time coherence of databases of network state at diverse geographic locations. Not only is the continual updating of such global state everywhere in the network an intensive real-time load, but inevitable incoherencies pose hazards in network operation. The alternative proposal is a framework that makes use of precise time synchronization and the computational power of network nodes to solve identical local instances of incremental reoptimization problems in situ. The scheme removes the database coherency hazard, reduces signaling volumes, and increases resource efficiencies in service provisioning. It also provides a framework in general for continually ongoing distributed reoptimization of network configuration. The proposal also points directions towards some new research questions such as implementation of optimization models for identical solution on disparate platforms and definition of a variety of incremental batch reoptimization problems. It is thought that this may be one of the first application concepts for transport network management that would involve on-line embedded use of operations research methods in communication networks.},

  title={INCA: Input-stationary Dataflow at Outside-the-box Thinking about Deep Learning Accelerators}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={29-41},
  abstract={This paper first presents an input-stationary (IS) implemented crossbar accelerator (INCA), supporting inference and training for deep neural networks (DNNs). Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM’s computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories—it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM’s nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy.},

  abstract={The soroban is a traditional arithmetic tool whose life in modern Japan reflected an inherently material dimension of computational numeracy. Using a system of commands to carry out operations, the soroban was both doubted and enthusiastically embraced by educators as a way of teaching basic mathematics, sparking conversations of what it really meant to understand arithmetic. Despite the introduction of Western-style pen and paper arithmetic, it persisted as the standard tool of computing in households, businesses, and bureaucracy, driving the Taylorist training of human calculators who could apply its commands with corporal discipline and the design of mechanical calculators that simplified its procedures. Even when educators held an “intuitive” ideal of mental calculation that moved students away from calculating with physical tools, the soroban persevered as a virtual interface that calculators accessed in their minds.},

  pages={3801-3802},
  abstract={Collaborative filtering (CF) from implicit datasets has attracted much attention in recent years. The current mainstream pairwise methods optimize the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and are empirically proven to be helpful to exploit implicit feedback, but lead to not addressing the rank-biased scenarios where positive items are supposed to be placed on the top-k positions. Although there exist listwise methods, they have low efficiency and are not particularly adequate for general implicit feedback situations. To that end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely Collaborative List-and-Pairwise Filtering (CLAPF), which aims to introduce pairwise thinking into listwise methods. Specifically, we first smooth a well-known rank-biased measure called Mean Average Precision (MAP) as a low-bound version to make it can be optimized. After that, we combined the objective functions of optimizing the MAP with pairwise comparisons. The CLAPF framework is a new hybrid model that provides the idea of utilizing a listwise measure in a pairwise way on implicit feedback.},

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.},

This limits their applicability for many applications with complex data dependency considerations. This paper aims to explore new methods of partitioning and distributing data in the cloud by fundamentally re-thinking the way in which future data management models will need to be developed on the Internet. Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach. The proposed model envisions a distributed data management scheme for large-scale data processing and database updating that is capable of providing scalable real-time recognition and processing with high accuracy while being able to maintain low computational cost in its function.},

  abstract={eScience is now an example field for conducting science using advanced computational methodologies, middle-ware and workflows. With the ever-increasing data intensity in various scientific disciplines and the opportunities provided by novel artificial intelligence (AI) and computing techniques, there is a pressing need for eScience to adapt and develop holistic approaches for AI-integrated science and interdisciplinary collaboration between science, AI and computing experts. This paper discusses the transformative shift needed in the conduct and tools of eScience from traditional workflows, often linear, pre-defined to coordinate task execution and individually developed, to integrated “teamflows”, a term coined to encapsulate methods for effective team collaboration and communication, dynamic data and service integration, and use-inspired thinking. In the AI in science era of scientific investigation, this “future of eScience” special track paper: 1) emphasizes the vital importance of eScience to the success of collaborative AI in science teams; 2) recites some requirements for open data and services for AI-enhanced workflows, team science and incentive structures to create a more inclusive and efficient discovery environment; and 3) discusses impact as a measure of success in eScience.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<; 0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<; 0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence is a booming technology and is applied in almost every domain of application. To design an intelligent system, a thorough understanding of complex AI Algorithm is required. The idea behind the AI Algorithm Simulator was born from the recognition that algorithms are a critical component of a person’s computational thinking and programming abilities. Despite their complexity, our AI Algorithm simulator seeks to make the subject more accessible and engaging for learners. The AI Algorithm Simulator is designed to be both interactive and visually appealing, providing learners with hands-on experience in implementing algorithms.},

  abstract={Label placement is very important when we display the electronic map. It will affect the beauty of electronic map. Furthermore, in order to display label placement in real-time, the computational complexity can not be too high. A novel algorithm of label placement is expounded based on the thinking of grid. It first divides the screen simply, then those three objects of points, arcs and polygons will be dealt with. The label configuration is reasonable, and does not result in any overlap. The experimental result indicates this algorithm is simple and effective. It can meet the demand of high quality map dynamic label placement and is successfully applied in commercial GIS.},

  abstract={There has been a global change of perception about right to education over the past few decades. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services. In this paper we present the usability evaluation of public cloud applications across three universities in Pakistan from stakeholders' perspective i.e. (teachers and students). Our experimental results show that there is lack of awareness on using cloud-based services for accessing educational resources.},

  abstract={High schools and undergraduate courses present several problems regarding teaching programming. In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Graph neural cellular automata are a recently introduced class of computational models that extend neural cellular automata to arbitrary graphs. They are promising in various applications based on preliminary test results and the successes of related computational models, such as neural cellular automata and convolutional and graph neural networks. However, all previous graph neural cellular automaton implementations have only been able to modify data associated with the vertices and edges, not the underlying graph topology itself. Here we introduce a method of encoding graph topology information as vertex data by assigning each edge and vertex an opacity value, which is the confidence with which the model thinks that that edge or vertex should be present in the output graph. Graph neural cellular automata equipped with this encoding method, henceforth referred to as translucent graph neural cellular automata, were tested in their ability to learn to reconstruct graphs from random subgraphs of them as a proof of concept. The results suggest that translucent graph neural cellular automata are capable of this task, albeit with optimal learning rates highly dependent on the graph to be reconstructed.},
