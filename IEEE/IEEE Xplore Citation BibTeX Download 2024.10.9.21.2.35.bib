  abstract={Modeling of a phenomenon plays a key role in scientific thinking, and therefore an important issue in teaching science. Formulation of a model depends on methods to manipulate it. So far, differential equations have played a major role in scientific modeling because of model analysis using mathematics. However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is a field within natural language processing that seeks to recognize and extract personal and emotional data from textual information, including feelings, viewpoints, and attitudes. Reviews have now turned into an indispensable data source for both consumers and businesses. Analyzing the sentiment of such reviews can offer valuable ideas into customers' likes, contentment, and discontentment. In recent times, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has paved new paths in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. In our work, sentiment of people is analyzed through reviews taken from people of various age groups from different educational backgrounds to understand the efficiency of ChatGPT. A comparative analysis was carried out by using four different machine learning models and two hybrid models using SVM + Decision Tree and Random Forest + Logistic Regression. The survey also analyzed various effects of using ChatGPT and how it contributes in making people lethargic and decreases logical thinking ability and problem-solving skills.},

  abstract={With the world becoming more and more reliant on technology, we are transitioning from a society that values rational evaluation over intuitive thinking to one in which both of those methods coexist. AI devices rely solely on rational evaluation and machine learning allows us to focus on intuition. The task of intelligence is to deduce which method should be relied upon when solving various problems via the establishment of realistic judgments, according to what kind it identifies as being best for that particular problem. However, human judgments cannot simply be quantitatively compared and ranked by a computer according to conditions set by algorithms because certain difficult-to-measure criteria are not easily passable through algorithm systems such as ethics and common sense. In this research, the authors focus on developing judgment classification models using random forest and support vector machine. The authors attempt to test the effectiveness of sentiment proportions as features in judgment classification models.},

  title={Investigating Persuasive Behaviors Across Different Opinion Polarities: A Study of Video Messages}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1176-1180},
  abstract={Interpreting subjectively what makes a person persuasive in online videos is a complex and dynamic process that requires critical thinking and active engagement from the part of the observer. With the rapid expansion of online communication through social networking websites, more persuasive content is made available online in the form of video. The use of positive and/or negative opinions might affect how persuasive someone appears to be. Persuasiveness is at the core of everyday human-human interactions, such as defending a client in a court, seeking a patient's compliance with medical advice or convincing a customer to buy a product. This study is motivated by the argument that persuasive behavior changes with opinion polarity and whether a speaker is trying to persuade one in favor of or against something. Emotion plays a key role in persuasion both in verbal and non-verbal communication, therefore understanding the impact of opinion polarity (sentiment) on the persuasive messages becomes increasingly important. The study aims to explain the” emotion” behind the message as expressed in negative and positive opinions both persuasive and unpersuasive videos. The data used for the analysis is derived from Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) dataset which is an online multimodal dataset with existing labels for persuasive and non-persuasive videos placed in two sentiment or opinion polarities (positive and negative). This research paper also introduced a new neuromarketing assessment method called NeuroMap's NeuroScoring tool, previously designed to evaluate persuasive messages through a neuromarketing perspective. The present study results align with the NeuroMap model's emphasis on the role of emotions in persuasion. The persuasion model suggests that emotions directly impact how people process and memorize information and how persuasive messages that evoke positive emotions are more likely to be effective. In the study, sentiment levels can be seen as indicators of emotional content conveyed in the video messages, and the positive relationship between sentiment levels and persuasiveness supports the view that emotional appeal plays a crucial role in influencing persuasion.},

  volume={42},
  number={6},
  pages={1529-1542},
  abstract={Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={137-144},
  abstract={The application of Grid technology is at the transition from engineering and natural science-related industrial sectors to other industries that have a high demand for computing resources. However, the diffusion of Grid technology within industrial sectors which are not naturally engineering and natural science-related is often hindered by a lack of incentives to share the computational resources. A promising way to overcome these barriers is the introduction of economically inspired mechanisms for the use of Grid-based resources. Our work introduces a iterated cost-based multi-unit resource auction (CMRA) and compares a traditional cost-based accounting approach with dedicated servers as well as a pooling approach with regard to service quality and total costs. The cost-calculus used in our model is based on costs for the delayed processing of jobs and costs for the cancellation of these jobs if the job cannot be provided at a certain time span in the worst case. The simulation results indicate that pooling of IT resources by Grid technology can produce a reduction of 20.3% in cost within this model compared to dedicated servers in the computing centers. However, with the CMRA-based allocation of computing resources, a further 1.4% of cost reduction can be achieved while the achieved quality-of-service (QoS) can be significantly increased. Finally we think that there must be a further cost reduction potential for Grid solutions beyond these savings that can be achieved by using economically inspired allocation methods that are combined with advanced refining and learning methods.},

  abstract={It is shown that the fundamental basis and the primary basis for the concepts in the field of algorithmization of modern intelligent systems lie in the philosophical knowledge of the world and the process of thinking as such. It is indicated that the creation of modern artificial intelligent systems is based primarily on the knowledge of the actual thinking of the person, his ability to create different ways, mechanisms, tools of intellectual activity. It is emphasized that algorithms are practically the first among them and have now become one of the main ways of building intelligent systems. It is stated that the theory of algorithms itself, as one of the basic and fundamental branches of mathematics, transforming in its time from philosophy, is based on studies of epistemology, the subject of which is the process of human knowledge as such, in its entirety. It is presented from the position of epistemology and ontology as fundamental sections for the philosophy that the creation of modern integrated modules of information technology systems is unthinkable without taking into account the complex of relationships, interactions in the system "man-machine", and algorithms are the leading way to develop any artificial systems, including intelligent systems. Science is an important area of human activity, always aimed at the development and systematization of objective knowledge about the real world.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem, inspired by the Think-Like-A-Vertex (TLAV) paradigm. The Vertex Cover problem, a fundamental challenge in graph theory, finds significant relevance in the context of the compute continuum, where the optimal placement of application images across a diverse range of computational resources is a critical concern. Our proposed TLAV-based algorithm addresses this challenge by leveraging local information at each vertex to make intelligent decisions, thereby reducing the global complexity of the problem. While this approach could potentially lead to resource overprovisioning, we argue that in the context of the compute continuum, this trade-off can provide more flexibility and redundancy, enhancing the reliability of the system. Through extensive analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on large-scale graphs, making a significant contribution to the field of resource management in the compute continuum.},

  abstract={Processes in the mind: perception, cognition, concepts, instincts, emotions, and higher cognitive abilities for abstract thinking, beautiful music are considered here within a neural modeling fields (NMFs) paradigm. Its fundamental mathematical mechanism is a process ¿from vague-fuzzy to crisp,¿ called dynamic logic (DL). This paper discusses why this paradigm is necessary mathematically, and relates it to a psychological description of the mind. Surprisingly, the process from ¿vague to crisp¿ corresponds to Aristotelian understanding of mental functioning. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements confirmed this process in neural mechanisms of perception.},

  abstract={In this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and ChatGPT was analyzed. The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT.},

  abstract={Representing human knowledge plays an important role in artificial intelligence science. Nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing knowledge such as semantic networks, conceptual graphs, computational networks. Computational Objects Knowledge Base (COKB) can be used to represent knowledge in many kinds of knowledge domain, such as Linear Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Direct Current Electrical Circuits. However, COKB model cannot be used to represent knowledge and solve problems about chemical elements efficiently. In this paper, we propose a variation of COKB model called Che-COKB which is the useful tool to represent knowledge about chemical elements and solve some kinds of problems in this knowledge domain. Furthermore, the algorithms for solving problems on model have been built up. In addition, the proposed model and algorithms were also applied to construct an application for solving some problems about chemical elements on mobile devices.},

  abstract={One important pedagogical approach is to motivate students actively learn and discover new knowledge by using contemporary instructional design methods. This is in sharp contrast to another approach that forces students to take a passive rote-learning strategy. To promote active learning, CityU Hong Kong adopted the so-called discovery-enriched curriculum (DEC) pedagogical approach to enhance student learning at the tertiary education setting. While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work. According to our best knowledge, this is one of the few successful research work of applying a topic modeling method to enhance the assessment of students' achievements under a DEC pedagogical approach. The practical application and implications of our work is that educational practitioners can apply the proposed computational method to facilitate the assessment of students' novel discoveries.},

Based on MAS technology, this paper constructs a collaborative control model for manufacturing system that integrates multiple production units. This model combines several intelligent modules and physical entities organically. Based on the cooperation between Multi-agents, the improved MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm is proposed. A new algorithm framework called DS_MADDPG (Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) is applied to this model. Through the cooperation of Multi-agents, a certain intelligent control system is formed so that it can accurately complete complex production tasks and achieve distributed collaborative control of the manufacturing process, which will drive manufacturing companies to transform into the smart manufacturing.},

  abstract={Involvement has become an important variable in consumer behavior and marketing research for a long time. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can explain the complicated relationship between antecedents, consequences, and different types of involvement at the same time to understand the internal state of consumers better. Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.},

  year={2022},
  volume={24},
  number={},
  pages={87-102},
  abstract={A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from suicidal ideation. As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion release, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms of suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual&#x0027;s suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93&#x0025; accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, <i>post, personality,</i> and <i>experience</i> are the top-3 key indicators. Under these categories, <i>posted text</i>, <i>stress level</i>, <i>stress duration</i>, <i>posted image</i>, and <i>ruminant thinking</i> contribute to one&#x0027;s suicidal ideation detection.},

  year={2020},
  volume={13},
  number={2},
  pages={312-325},
  abstract={A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.},

  abstract={Adaptive online learning can facilitate students' support by responding immediately to the user's interactions. Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support.},

The research was delineated with a methodology of action research, which made possible the evaluation of the Scratch language and the pseudocode at the end of the approach of each content. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate that the use of the Scratch language presented better results during the initial stages; as the complexity of the content increased, the use of the pseudocode produced better results. Nevertheless, it is worth noting the good acceptance of the Scratch language for the teaching-learning process of the contents, as well as the contribution that it has had to the learning of logic and programming algorithms.},

  abstract={Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems.},

  abstract={Despite the enthusiasm and initiatives for making programming accessible to students outside Computer Science (CS), unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions about how we should be teaching programming to engineers, scientists, artists or other non-CS majors. We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

We conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. We find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose that the data generated by educational robots can be better used by applying learning analytics methods and techniques which can lead to a deeper understanding of the learners' apprehension and behavior as well as refined guidelines for roboticists and improved interventions by the teachers. As a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team and/or individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.},

  abstract={Starting from our teaching experience and previous research on programming for non-technical university students in Japan and Denmark, we identify an unarticulated dependency of programming materials from other technical domains, which causes a knowledge domain mismatch in learners. We approach this mismatch on two fronts: by defining a novel way to structure beginners courses that moves away from the classic bottom-up approach based on math-related problems, and instead leverages on multimedia as a motivational and powerful general-purpose domain to ground programming and scaffold its understanding; and via the design and implementation of new Python library that simplifies multimedia programming. We are currently organizing tests of both multimedia library and the new course structure in Japan and Denmark.},

  abstract={In order to realize a cooperative supercomputing environment, Large-scale scientific simulation data should be exchanged among supercomputers over the internet. To maintain the interactivity of the time-series simulation in such an environment, real-time data compression is required. Given the accuracy requirements of scientific simulation, we only focus on lossless data compression. In this paper, we propose Think Mantissa as Integer method to decrease the entropy of scientific datasets, achieving a good compression ratio and speeds. We evaluate this scheme in two experiments and compare it with the existing compression strategies (gzip, bzip2). Our approach gets about a 30% improvement in the compression ratio and hundreds of times speed acceleration. We also computed the total time of the data transfer using this method under some specific bandwidth cases, and nearly all of them have gotten a good acceleration.},

  pages={213-222},
  abstract={Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

  abstract={The work presented in this Full Paper is categorized as Innovative Practice, as per FIE guidelines. Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.},

  abstract={This innovative practice work in progress paper discusses the integration of Model-Eliciting Activities (MEA) into in software engineering (SE) classes, and the challenges faced in preparing and delivering these activities. The preparation and implementation of MEA in SE classes can be challenging, as it requires creating self-assessable MEA questions that simulate real-world problems, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing learning outcomes. In this research, the authors address these challenges and gain practical experience in designing and implementing MEA in SE classes. The authors conducted experiments over two consecutive semesters in SE courses that cover topics such as requirement solicitation, design and implementation, software testing techniques, secure software, and software quality assurance. They incorporated MEA questions that simulate real-world problems into both face-to-face and online classes, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing the learning gains. This paper contributes to the distribution of MEA application for SE courses. It presents the authors' experiences, challenges, reports evaluations, and findings in implementing MEA in SE courses. Overall, this paper provides insights into the effective integration of MEA into SE courses, and the benefits it can bring to students' learning outcomes.},

  abstract={The computer chess is an important research direction of artificial intelligence. Amazon chess game is an extremely complicated strategy game and the search algorithm relies heavily on the evaluation function. The design of evaluation function faces great challenges. This process requires a comprehensive consideration of the characteristics of the board and build up a series of complex formulas, which requires a lot of human experience to support. The author tries to apply the reinforcement learning method to the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function. Using the self-game generated data sets and reward signals to stimulates network, it could learn how to evaluate the situation of chess board without human experience. Then this neural network can be used as an evaluation function. Finally, through battling with the game of Amazon chess game using traditional evaluation function, it is verified that the evaluation function design method proposed in this paper can reduce the human experience requirement in the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function and effectively evaluate the situation.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been used as a tool for various visual storytelling, but text-to-image models are a stochastic machine learning process that requires human intervention to assist creation better. As we all know, pre-visualization is an important stage in film production, involving subjective choices by the creators. This paper investigates how AI can assist filmmakers during the pre-production stage by generating mood boards from text. We propose a novel preproduction pipeline and guidelines that leverage text-to-image models to create visual previews of film projects. We also conduct a case study to validate and evaluate our approach's effectiveness. Our case study suggests that following the guidelines we have developed can assist filmmakers in generating mood boards that effectively convey the desired atmosphere of their projects and potentially contribute to enhancing the creative process. Our paper aims to contribute to the field of AI art and the film industry.},

  abstract={The Digital Logic and Computer Architecture related courses are one of the key knowledge areas in Computer Science (CS) used to enhance students' understanding of Boolean algebra, logic gates, registers, arithmetic logic units, etc. and provides insights how software and hardware are related in a computing system. Experimental Centric based Instructional Pedagogy (ECP) with portable laboratory instrumentation might provide real hands-on experience to obtain a practical understanding of the concepts at a lower cost compared to virtual hands-on laboratories. This paper presents the initial adaptation of an evidence-based, experiment-focused teaching approach to introduce the fundamentals of digital logic concepts using the commercial ADALM 1K Active Learning Module in a Computer Architecture course for the first time in the CS department at a university serving predominantly minority students. To evaluate the impact of the ECP on student performance in the Computer Architecture course, we conducted three different evaluations, which are class observation, signature assignment, and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MLSQ) survey. The results of the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) show more student engagement when ECP is implemented; the output of the signature assignment shows an increase in students' learning outcomes; and the MLSQ survey, which tests the students' motivation, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration, and metacognition, ascertains the effect of the ECP on the CS students who participated in the experiment.},

  abstract={As computing technologies develop, there is a trend in traffic simulation research in which the focus is moving from macro- and meso-simulation to micro-simulation since micro-simulation can provide more detailed quantitative results. Moreover, the success of the Artificial societies-Computational experiments-Parallel execution (ACP) approach indicates that integrating other metropolitan systems such as logistic, infrastructure, legal and regulatory, and weather and environmental systems to build an Artificial Transportation System (ATS) can be helpful in solving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) problems. However, the computational burden is very heavy as there are many agents interacting in parallel in the ATS. Therefore, a parallel computing tool is desirable. We think that we can employ a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which has been applied in many areas. In this paper, we use a GPU-adapted Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to solve the problem of generating daily activity plans for individual and household agents in the ATS, which is important as the activity plans determine the traffic demand in the ATS. Previous research has shown that GA is effective but that the computational burden is heavy. We extend the work to GPU and test our method on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU for two scenarios of generating plans for 1000 individual agents and 1000 three-person household agents. Speedup factors of 23 and 32 are obtained compared with implementations on a mainstream CPU.},

  abstract={Artificial neural network is an intelligent bionic model based on physiology, which simulates the thinking ability of human brain, and finds out regular things by studying, recalling, summarizing and sorting out a large number of cases. Because of the heterogeneity, distribution and dynamics of grid, traditional resource management methods are not suitable for grid environment. In view of the fact that the traditional resource management model can't meet the demand of service grid, this paper studies the resource management model based on the principles of computational economics and the characteristics of service grid environment, and proposes a resource management model based on computational economics. Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to establish a national economic forecasting model. In the process of modeling, immune particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the neural network model, so that the predicted data of the model is closer to the actual data.},

  abstract={In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are in higher demand more than ever before. While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today's problems. It is not just desirable but essential that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis surveys a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as are used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis illustrates the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in analyzing network data, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. It also discusses some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions that arise in network analysis and social influences.},

  abstract={A cellular automaton (CA) recently developed by D.H. Rothman and J.M. Keller (1988) simulates the flow of two incompressible, immiscible, viscous fluids in two dimensions. This automaton has been simulated on the CM-2 Connection Machine using a sequence of logical operations and table lookups to determine the state of a CA site from its old state and those of its neighbors. The logical operations are performed in parallel by each of the Connection Machine processors, while the table lookups use the indirect addressing capabilities among groups of 32 processors. A description is given of CA fluids, including the issue of isotropy, the choice of a rule set, and the averaging procedure used to obtain hydrodynamical quantities. The CM-2 Connection Machine is then described, with emphasis on the indirect addressing capabilities of the machine. A complete description is also given of the Rothman-Keller model for two-phase flow. It is shown how the indirect addressing is used in the simulation algorithm, and how a symmetry in the dynamics is used to reduce the size of the lookup tables by a factor of six. A time sequence of results showing the separation of two immiscible phases from an initially homogenized state is presented.<>},

  abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR) is an utilitarian tool to capture diverse information from decision makers under uncertain situations. How to improve the unacceptable consistency level for HFLPR is a key issue to guarantee the reliability of the decision information. This paper introduces the worst consistency index for HFLPRs to judge the logic of DMs in the worst case. Under the purpose of minimizing the amount of modification, an optimization model is constructed to achieve an acceptable worst consistency level for a HFLPR. A linear programming model is established to reduce the difficulty of solving the presented optimization model. It ensures the consistency indices related to all the possible linguistic preference relations (LPRs) from a given HFLPR meet the predefined consistency level requirement. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a numerical example to show it's significance.},

Prediction of ASD using video recordings is an open-ended critical problem in machine learning to facilitate the process of early intervention which requires high computational resources. This research aims to predict ASD in children using videos by extracting features and converting them into a binary classification problem thereby eliminating the need for high computational resources. This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively. In this article, we offer an overview of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder whilst focusing on the importance of video datasets.},

  pages={2070-2077},
  abstract={Hybrid state estimation determines the states of systems monitored both by conventional SCADA measurements and PMUs. This paper proposes a decentralization method in order to improve the computational performance of hybrid state estimators with minimum loss of accuracy. The proposed method utilizes sensitivity matrix that relates measurement errors to state estimates in order to form the so-called isolated bus groups and observable subislands. Although the proposed decentralization method can be applied to any state estimator, the paper is developed using a least absolute value (LAV) estimator for demonstration purposes, which is known to be robust against bad data. The high computational burden of LAV estimator compared to the well-known weighted least squares estimator is eliminated, thanks to the proposed decentralization method.},

  abstract={This paper explores impediments to innovation in aerospace and suggests how successful pathways from other industries can be adopted to facilitate greater innovation. Because of its nature, space exploration would seem to be a ripe field of technical innovation. However, engineering can also be a frustratingly conservative endeavor when the realities of cost and risk are included. Impediments like the ¿find the fault¿ engineering culture, the treatment of technical risk as almost always evaluated in terms of negative impact, the difficult to account for expansive Moore's Law growth when making predictions, and the stove-piped structural organization of most large aerospace companies and federally funded research laboratories tend to inhibit cross-cutting technical innovation. One successful example of a multi-use cross cutting application that can scale with Moore's Law is the Evolutionary Computational Methods (ECM) technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Lab for automated spectral retrieval. Future innovations like computational engineering and automated design optimization can potentially redefine space exploration, but will require learning lessons from successful innovators.},

  abstract={This paper describes a computational infrastructure used to support creative design in detecting emergent shapes in the specific context of shape grammar implementation. Shape grammars have been used to represent the knowledge behind the creative work of architects, designers and artists. This kind of grammars are inherently visual and they allow the implementation of computational mechanisms to either synthesize or analyze designs of visual languages, including the detection of emergent sub-shapes languages. They have obvious applications to design, including for marketing. The infrastructure presented, together with the algorithm to which it gives support, the latter proposed in another, twin, paper, is a core component of a system, described in our past work, that allows users to build their own shape grammars and experiment with and use them.},

  abstract={A pattern classifier named Hash-based Associative Memory-like Pattern Classifier (HAPC) based on hashing technique, associative memory, and human deep-thinking logic is proposed in this paper to solve pattern classification problems without complicated mathematical computation. In the hashing layer of the designed system, one of the similarity-preserve hashing is used to convert the input samples to hashed data which dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the data but keeps the similarity information. In the clustering layer, hashed samples are divided into different clusters, which can be considered a feature extraction process based on the similarity of the hash value. In the associate memory layer, each cluster will be trained as an associate memory to store the hashed data stably. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is used to perform the decision-making process to classify the testing sample without complicated mathematical computation. In the simulation, we are able to achieve a good result, especially on small numbers of training data.},

  abstract={Reasoning, a trait of cognitive intelligence, is regarded as a crucial ability that distinguishes humans from other species. However, neural networks now pose a challenge to this human ability. Text-to-image synthesis is a class of vision and linguistics, wherein the goal is to learn multimodal representations between the image and text features. Hence, it requires a high-level reasoning ability that understands the relationships between objects in the given text and generates high-quality images based on the understanding. Text-to-image translation can be termed as the visual thinking of neural networks. In this study, our model infers the complicated relationships between objects in the given text and generates the final image by leveraging the previous history. We define diverse novel adversarial loss functions and finally demonstrate the best one that elevates the reasoning ability of the text-to-image synthesis. Remarkably, most of our models possess their own reasoning ability. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with several methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  pages={85-90},
  abstract={Accurate recognition of the meaning of words in the given document fragments has a long historical standing in computational linguistics. Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms.},

The combination of these approaches helps to better understand the future alternatives available to decision-makers by combining storytelling with trend extrapolation using a proposed new hybrid process called FLighTS (Future Lighthouse Trending Scenarios). Thus, in the process of determining the most appropriate future, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to vague and ambiguous value judgments in the process of inference of decision makers.The work presented in this article aims to improve the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to facilitate further exploration of the possibilities of a new non-linear way of thinking about the future.

  abstract={While most contemporary researchers argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides overwhelming and profound advancements in technology and beneficial tools used daily to advance human life on earth, there exist a host of other researchers who hold contrary opinions to this view, with regard to the rising adverse ontological and existential consequences which the products of super-intelligent technologies has on an alarming number of mankind in the 21st century. Scholars like Vardi, Tegmark and Greene likened this scenario to a time-bomb waiting to go off any moment. The recent endorsement of 23 AI principles by 1200 AI/Robotics researchers and over 2342 other researchers from diverse disciplines, in a just concluded Future of Life (FLI) Conference, adds credence to the worries which most researchers have about the presumed benefits of AI to mankind. The study draws from a combination of Marxian Alienation and ontological theories which basically holds that: rising advancements in AI technologies, continues to alienate mankind from his existential human nature. The ex-post facto research design in the social sciences and Deriders' deconstructive and critical reconstructive analytic method in philosophy, for interrogating the meaning of concepts, arguments and current debates on the relevance and risks of IA, were adopted for the study. The study identified justifiable grounds and reasons for the alarm raised over current innovations in the field of AI technologies. The study strengthen the resolve of current researchers to identify ways of reducing or avoiding the impending adverse consequences of evolving conscious AI and machines in the feature. The research proposes a radical legal enforcement and adoption of the 23 newly established AI principles as one of the pertinent measure for saving mankind from the impending threats posed by innovations powered by advances in AI technology.},

  abstract={Human cognition stems from his identifying the relationship or relative distance between himself and any other objects or persons, for which prerequisite is establishing his 'self'. In other words, it is presumable that the potential of intelligent machine's establishing its 'self' would require us to engineer its sense of 'ego' and 'intention', which involves such factors as 'emotions', 'instincts', and 'sensibilities'. This dissertation introduces the psycho-quantum theory which illustrates the human psychodynamics by the quantum mechanics approach, and its application for constructing the distribution model of emotional modalities and the autonomous system, the essential elements for creating an ego in a computer. We have attempted to create the artificial 'ego' and 'desire' based on our probability model and state transition analysis, then accordingly developed our methodology of the artificial thought process as well as the judging mechanism of such computer. Furthermore, this dissertation introduces the sensibility inference function of our psycho-quantum computer, by which we discuss our methods to itemize 126 emotional modalities of human, construct the three-dimensional dynamic model of emotions, and analyze the emotion distribution and its longitudinal modal transition so as to derive the artificial instinct and to determine/infer its relationship with external factors. Currently, our technology to construct the comprehensive psycho-quantum computer is yet in developmental stage; however, its potential is enormous so that it will constitute a key technology in new robotics industry.},

  abstract={The surge of interest in artificial intelligence systems has sparked new directions of research in the realm of music data analysis. At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions. We claim that the presented approach not only opens avenues for penetrating and nuanced analysis, but also enriches our comprehension of the intricate interplay of musical components and their manifestations inspired by neural networks.},

  abstract={Due to the limited data transmission capability, most of the sensor nodes in the wireless sensor networks(WSN) cannot send data to the base station directly. In most situations the data transfer has to be done by the means of multi-hop. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH) is one of the most widely used multi-hop strategies. However, as there are many random factors interrelated with each other in the networks, it's very difficult to evaluate the network performance for LEACH, which has become a hotpot of current research. Since lifetime is the most important network performance indicator, this paper collects the network operation parameters including working period through multi-agent simulation and computational experiments, and evaluates the network performance in different situations based on the collected data. The results would provide practical advices for optimizing the network performance and come up with a new thinking of adopting multi-agent simulation in WSN research.},

  abstract={Common cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke are the major cause of mortality and disability in recent decades. Increased blood viscosity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Elevated blood viscosity is associated with atherosclerosis and its growth. The knowledge of the arterial hemodynamics resulted due to atherosclerosis with different level of blood viscosity can clarify the relationship between artery stenosis and symptoms, and, finally, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Hence proficient imaging of blood flow has great clinical importance to understand the origin and evolution of disease. Therefore, investigation and detection of viscosity change and its effect might be helpful for better diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. In this simulation work, hemo-disturbances are studied in a carotid artery finite element model (FEM) with atherosclerosis under different viscosities consideration using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The obtained FEM data are used to reconstruct color flow image of blood velocities using ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals to study atherosclerosis detecting the viscosity changes. The findings of this study suggest that ultrasound based blood flow image can detect the viscosity change effect related to atherosclerosis growth. We think the findings will be helpful to develop effective ultrasound imaging technique for atherosclerosis diagnosis.},

  abstract={The ability to think has been one of the most fascinating features of robots in science fiction since the introduction of the word 'robot' by Karel Capek in his Czech science fiction play, known as 'Rossum's Universal Robots' in English [1]. Since Capek's first depiction in 1921, science fictionists generally portray robots as intelligent humanoid machines that are subservient to humans. Android is another term used for such robots in modern linguistics. However, the development of robots with the ability to think has largely been a fantasy for robot scientists and engineers. Nevertheless, the evolution of robots has come a long way since the first industrial robot 'Unimate' in 1954. Robots have transformed from large automated manufacturing facilities to applications in our homes and even into our pockets as software robots in our PDAs and smart phones [2], [3]. This paper classifies robot intelligence into six categories: cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioral intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. This classification categorizes the intelligence of robots based on the different aspects of awareness and the ability to act deliberately as a result of such awareness.},

We hope, however, that our work's meta-contribution is to show, by proof of concept, that you must consider simple, sideways system attacks before you can rely on a system. We encourage engineers of mission-critical systems to look for then cavemen (or squirrels) and to study carefully what actions these adversaries might take against the products they roll out. In this paper we examine simple attacks on routing protocols for wireless networks.

  abstract={During 2016-19, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded the “Connect Everything: Industrial Systems in the Digital Age” programme (£ 1m) and adopted the German-initiated term “Industry 4.0” for the coming a priori “industrial revolution”. As part of this programme, University of Glasgow hosted the EPSRC’s first conference on this topic - “Looking Beyond Industry 4.0”. The success of this programme led to another round of £ 1m funding for “Connected Everything II: Accelerating Digital Manufacturing Research Collaboration and Innovation” (2019-22), so as “to make the most of this fourth industrial revolution”. The first three Industrial Revolutions took place a posteriori, and mostly, were concerned with assisting and liberating humans from physical labour. Today, should the a priori Industry 4.0 differ from the previous industrial revolutions? If so, would the difference be in a focus on assisting and liberating humans from mental labour for the first time? The recent World Economic Forum highlighted four main design principles of this revolution: (1) Interoperability, (2) Information transparency, (3) Cognitive and physical assistance (4) Decentralised decisions and actions. Coinciding with this wave of revolution is the third wave of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently in its earnest resurgence. It is now possible to develop computational AI technology to surpass a human designer in innovation and creativity, just like AlphaGo Zero in London to have surpassed AlphaGo and humans in Go playing. The progress of science and technology now heavily relies on simulation-based ‘third paradigm of science’ in the form of ‘computer-aided design’ (CAD). AI can transform CAD simulations to predictive simulations for ‘computer-automated design’ (CAutoD), which becomes possible through AI with the increased computing power and data. Thus, CAutoD should help Industry 4.0 to achieve mass customisation at a mass production cost in the near future. However, design, manufacturing and service all need to be taken into account for factory-floor innovation in order to deliver transformative improvements in performance, productivity and time-to-market. Commensurate with the ‘intelligent manufacturing’ value chain and ‘market informatics’ at the end of this value chain, such Industry 4.0 would enhance innovation, creativity and competitiveness.},

  abstract={The creation of navigable, geographic art and its interactions is a novel, ideal environment for a computationally creative system. In this paper, we present a system that utilizes a canvas of city blocks to draw paths that represent the mood of the user, or if none is provided, it picks inspiration for itself. By being provided with user mood input, the system then identifies images that represent the provided emotion and, on its own volition, plots a path for the user to traverse. This kind of art is often classified as Strava Art which has been a hobby within online groups as early as 2015. The presented system utilizes techniques for translation and navigation of geodetic data provided by OpenStreetMap, processing images in the knowledge base for geographic display, and error checking through the use of Hausdorff calculations. Through a publicly administered survey, it was demonstrated that the system is effective at generating artifacts that are representative of the selected image.

This would allow the software on the device to give an accessible, hands-on experience to the students. No significant access to external computing resources is required, limiting the amount of data traffic generated by the use of the software.

  abstract={Poetry generation is a branch of text generation that demands a high level of linguistic proficiency and creativity. The Urdu language, renowned for its rich poetic tradition, encompasses a diverse collection of poets, each possessing a unique writing style. This research explores the automatic generation of Urdu poetry, specifically Urdu ghazals which hold a significant cultural value using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including deep learning. The dataset used consists of 17,609 couplets from the works of 15 renowned Urdu ghazal poets. We use three different approaches for poetry generation which include (a) the n-gram probabilistic model, (b) deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU, and (c) the state-of-the-art GPT-2 model. BLEU scores for each of these were (a) 0.5 for the n-gram model, (b) 0.1 for LSTM and GRU and, (c) 0.6 for the GPT-2 model, which was the highest overall score. In addition to the BLEU score, other metrics such as rhyming score and human evaluation were considered for evaluating the generated poetry. This research is the first to use transformer-based models for Urdu poetry generation, which enables aspiring poets to learn from and be inspired by the rich tradition of Urdu poetry.},

We observed the behavior and attitudes of 42 children from three age groups: 6-7 years, 8-10 years, and 10-12 years. Through our observations, we identified six different types of surprising robot behaviors: personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays, and freezing. Using a qualitative analysis, we examined how children responded to each type of behavior, and we observed similarities and differences between the age groups. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots.},

The proposed CAD comprises the following stages: image enhancement, liver segmentation, feature extraction and characterization of HCC by means of classifiers. In the proposed CAD framework, a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification methods are introduced for HCC diagnosis. For training and testing, the recorded biomarkers and the associated imaging data are fused. The classification accuracy of the proposed system is critically analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. In addition, laboratory biomarkers are also used to cross-validate the diagnosis.},

  pages={154-159},
  abstract={The human nervous system is the controlling mechanism for coordinating all body-related activities. In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.},

  pages={101-108},
  abstract={Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.},

  abstract={Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.},

Our three-stage framework, leads the learner through a series of tasks, each designed to develop different skills necessary for coming up with creative, innovative, effective, and purposeful visualizations. For that, we get the learners to create an explanatory visualization of an algorithm of their choice. By making an algorithm choice, and by following an active-learning and project-based strategy, the learners take ownership of a particular visualization challenge. They become enthusiastic to develop good results and learn different creative skills on their learning journey.},

In order to let the students in higher vocational colleges master the attack and defense skills of cross site scripting, it's essential to let them have the opportunity to truly practice the attacking behaviors as hackers do, and to practice the defense countermeasures as web site administrators do. In this paper, we have developed an attacking and defense lab environment for cross site scripting education in higher vocational colleges. Our experience shows that by using this lab environment, students can better understand what cross site scripting vulnerabilities are, why they occur, how to exploit them and how to fix them. We suggest that a lot more researches need to be done in the area of developing attacking and defense lab environments in order to improve the outcomes of network security education in higher vocational colleges.},

In Fall, 2012, we piloted the use of automated text analysis to facilitate the use of written formative assessment for Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in a large-enrollment introductory biology course at a large public Midwestern university. A total of 12,677 student responses to 15 online homework questions were collected in three 300+ student course sections with four instructors. We used automated analysis to create feedback for instructors before the next class period (less than one working day), so that instructions could use this feedback to inform their instruction. Instructors used many of the questions pre- and post-instruction and the reports we provided to them allowed them to see how their students' answers changed as a result of their instruction. Focus groups with the instructors revealed that they already knew some of the topics that challenged students, as revealed in previous semesters with multiple-choice examinations. However, the instructors pointed out that the written assessments were particularly important for gaining insight as to why students have struggled continuously with these ideas.},

  abstract={The article proposes an canvas-oriented approach to game design. It justifies the applying of a dynamic cycle of interconnected canvases into creative game design, for the purpose of documenting the progress and results of the creative process, stimulating it while canvases simultaneously are both clues and guides in game development. The author's definition of game design canvasation as a process of creation of a visual abstract structure that generalizes the case goal (the task containing the accumulated experience) for achieving it and creating a unique creative product is given. Projects “Canvas of Player Psychotypes & Aethteticts”, “Canvas of Player's needs in Control, Information and Action”, “Canvas of Game Mechanics & Dynamics”, “Canvas of Narrative”, “Canvas of the Game World”, “Canvas of Game Level” “Canvas of Ethical Dilemma” are presented. Canvases structure the game development process, reduce the time taken to generate game designer ideas and to contrive game mechanic and dynamics. Canvases are an additional road map toward making creative decisions in game design. They can be a convenient basis for automating the process of latter, a paper prototype of the game and the game design as a quest process provided that each canvas is a location with quest tasks, the variability of which depends on the potential and attitude of the leader and team. Subsequently, it is planned to develop algorithm for routing the components of the canvases also will be developed, allowing to automate the process of filling out sections of the Game Design Document.},
